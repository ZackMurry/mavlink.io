Developer Guide\n\nMAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components).\nMAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as topics while configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point with retransmission.\nMessages are defined within XML files.\nEach XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system, also referred to as a \"dialect\". \nThe reference message set that is implemented by most ground control stations and autopilots is defined in common.xml (most dialects build on top of this definition).\nThe MAVLink toolchain uses the XML message definitions to generate MAVLink libraries for each of the supported programming languages.\nDrones, ground control stations, and other MAVLink systems use the generated libraries to communicate.\nThese are typically MIT-licensed, and can therefore be used without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.\n\n The C reference implementation is a

Telemetry data streams are sent in a multicast design while protocol aspects that change the system configuration and require guaranteed delivery like the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point with retransmission.\nMAVLink 2 Packet Format\nBelow is the over-the-wire format for a MAVLink v2 packet. \nThe in-memory representation might differ.\nuint8_t magic;              ///\nuint8_t signature[13];      ///\n\n The MAVLink 1 packet format is similar, but omits incompat_flags, compat_flags and signature, and only has a single byte for the message address.\n  For more information see Serialization > Packet Format.\n\nSerialization\nThe over-the-wire format of MAVLink is optimized for resource-constrained systems and hence the field order is not the same as in the XML specification. \nThe over-the-wire generator sorts all fields of the message according to size, with the largest fields (uint64_t) first, then down to smaller fields. \nThe sorting is done using a stable sorting algorithm, which ensures that any fields that do not need to be reordered stay in the same relative order. \nThis prevents alignment issues on the encoding / decoding systems and allows for very efficient packing / unpacking.\nFor more information and specific exceptions see Serialization.\nMulticast Streams vs. Guaranteed Delivery\nMAVLink is built for hybrid networks where high-rate data streams from data sources (commonly drones) flow to data sinks (commonly ground stations), but are mixed with transfers requiring guaranteed delivery. \nThe key insight is that for most telemetry streams there is not a known or single recipient: Instead, typically an onboard computer, a ground control station and a cloud system all need the same data stream.\nOn the other hand configuring the onboard mission or changing the system configuration with onboard parameters requires point-to-point communication with guaranteed delivery. \nMAVLink achieves very high efficiency by allowing both modes of operation.\nTopic Mode (publish-subscribe)\nIn topic mode the protocol will not emit a target system and component ID for messages to save link bandwidth. \nTypical examples for this communication mode are all autopilot data streams like position, attitude, etc.\nThe main benefit of this multicast mode is that no additional overhead is generated and multiple subscribers can all receive this data.\nPoint-to-Point Mode\nIn point-to-point mode MAVLink uses a target ID and target component. \nIn most cases where these fields are used the sub-protocol also ensures guaranteed delivery (missions, parameters, commands).\nIntegrity Checks / Checksum\nMAVLink implements two integrity checks: The first check is on the integrity of the packet during transmission using the X.25 checksum (CRC-16-CCITT). This however only ensures that the data has not been altered on the link - it does not ensure consistency with the data definition. The second integrity check is on the data description to ensure that two messages with the same ID are indeed containing the same information. To achieve this the data definition itself is run through CRC-16-CCITT and the resulting value is used to seed the packet CRC. Most reference implementations store this constant in an array named CRC_EXTRA.\n"},"about/faq.html":{"url":"about/faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nUsers\n\n  How efficient is MAVLink?\n  MAVLink is a very efficient protocol. MAVLink 1 has just 8 bytes overhead per packet, including start sign and packet drop detection. MAVLink 2 has just 14 bytes of overhead (27 if signing is used), but is now a much more extensible protocol.\n\n  How many vehicles does MAVLink support?\n  255 vehicles, with system IDs ranging from 1 to 255 (0 is not a valid vehicle ID).\n    Note: Strictly speaking MAVLink supports 255 concurrent systems, and these can include a mix of vehicles, GCS, antenna trackers and other hardware.\n\n  Where can I use MAVLink?\n  MAVLink has been shown to work on multiple microcontrollers and operating systems, including ARM7, ATMega, dsPic, STM32 and Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS.\n\n  How reliable is MAVLink?\n  Very. MAVLink has been used since 2009 to communicate between many different vehicles, ground stations (and other nodes) over varied and challenging communication channels (high latency/noise). It provides methods for detecting packet drops, and the well-established ITU X.25 checksum for packet corruption detection.\n\n  How secure is MAVLink?\n  MAVLink provides message signing, which allows systems to authenticate that messages are from a trusted source. MAVLink does not provide message encryption.  \n  \n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  Can I use MAVLink in a closed source application without copyright issues?\n  Yes, without any limitations. The generated MAVLink library headers are made available under the *MIT license* (for more information see: Introduction > License).\n  \n\n  How does MAVLink detect and decode messages in the byte stream?\n  MAVLink waits for the packet start sign, then reads the packet length and matches the checksum after n bytes. If the checksum matches, it returns the decoded packet and waits again for the start sign. If bytes are altered or lost, it will drop the current message and continue the next try on the following message.\n\n  MAVLink uses only one start sign - isn't this less safe than using two or three start signs?\n  No. We use the CRC check to reliably determine whether a complete message has been received. Using additional start signs may increase likelihood of detecting the start point, but would provide no greater certainty of message validity. Since extra signs would increase bytes on the communication link, we choose not to use them.\n\n  What are the system and component IDs for?\n  The system ID represents the identity of a particular MAVLink system (vehicle, GCS, etc.). MAVLink can be used with up to 255 systems at the same time. The component ID reflects a component that is part of a larger system - for example a system might include an autopilot, companion computer and/or camera, which can be separately addressed. The component ID therefore lets MAVLink be used for both on- and off-board communication.\n\n  Why is the sequence number in the MAVLink header needed?\n  MAVLink is part of the safety critical components of an unmanned air system. A bad communication link dropping many packets can endanger the flight safety of the aircraft and has to be monitored. Having the sequence in the header allows MAVLink to continuously provide feedback about the packet drop rate and thus allows the aircraft or ground control station to take action.\n\n  Why is CRC_EXTRA needed in the packet checksum?\n  The CRC_EXTRA CRC is used to verify that the sender and receiver have a shared understanding of the over-the-wire format of a particular message \n  (required because as a lightweight protocol, the message structure isn't included in the payload).\n  \n  In MAVLink 0.9 the CRC was not used (although there was a length check). \n  There were a small number of cases where XML describing a message changed without changing the message length, \n  leading to badly corrupted fields when messages were read.\n\n  I would like to help improve the decoding/encoding routines or other features. Can MAVLink be changed?\n  Yes, but only very, very carefully with safety testing. \n  MAVLink is used as a safety-critical component in many autopilot systems and has undergone many years of testing. Please suggest new features on the MAVLink support channels.\n\n"},"about/implementations.html":{"url":"about/implementations.html","title":"Implementations","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink

that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. \nIt is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.\nThis topic explains how to get and use the library.\nGetting Libraries \nIf you are using a standard dialect then download the MAVLink 2 library from Github: c_library_v2.\n\n The MAVLink 2 library supports both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1, and is rebuilt for all the standard dialects whenever any of the definitions in the mavlink/mavlink repo change.\n  It supersedes the MAVLink 1 library (c_library_v1), and should be used by preference.\n\nIf you need libraries for a custom dialect then you will need to install mavgen and generate them yourself.\nThese can then be used in the same way as the pre-generated libraries.\nThe libraries can be placed/generated anywhere in your project tree.\nThe example below shows them located in: generated/include/mavlink/v2.0/.\nUpgrading Library from MAVLink 1\nThe MAVLink 1 pre-built library mavlink/c_library_v1 can be upgraded by simply dropping in the MAVLink 2 library from Github: mavlink/c_library_v2.\nThe MAVLink 2 C library offers the same range of APIs as was offered by MAVLink 1. \n\n The major change from an API perspective is that you don't need to provide a message CRC table any more, or message length table.\n  These have been folded into a single packed table, replacing the old table which was indexed by msgId.\n  That was necessary to cope with the much larger 24 bit namespace of message IDs.\n\nMAVLink 2 usage is covered in the following sections (this includes Working with MAVLink 1 which explains how you can communicate with both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1 (only) libraries.\nAdding Libraries\nTo use MAVLink in your C project, include the mavlink.h header file for your dialect:\n#include \n\nThis will automatically add the header files for all messages in your dialect, and for any dialect files that it includes.\n\n Only include the header file for a single dialect.\n  If you need to support messages from a number of dialects then create a new \"parent\" dialect XML file that includes them (and use its generated header as shown above).\n\n\n\n Do not include the individual message files.\n  If you generate your own headers, you will have to add their output location to your C compiler's search path.\n\nWhen compiling the project, we recommend that you specify the top-level output directory AND all generated dialects and versions (this will give the greatest compatibility with existing code and examples):\n$ gcc ... -I generated/include -I generated/include/common ...\n\nIn order to send messages you will also need to declare a variable mavlink_system in the global scope, specifying the system id and component ID of your component:\nmavlink_system_t mavlink_system = {\n    1, // System ID (1-255)\n    1  // Component ID (a MAV_COMPONENT value)\n};\n\nMultiple Streams (\"channels\") \nThe C MAVLink library utilizes a \"channel\" metaphor to allow for simultaneous processing of multiple, independent MAVLink streams in the same program.\nAll receiving and transmitting functions provided by this library require a channel, and it is important to use the correct channel for each operation.\nBy default up to 16 channels may be defined on Windows, Linux and macOS, and up to 4 channels may be define on other systems.\nSystems can specify a different maximum number of channels/comms buffers using MAVLINK_COMM_NUM_BUFFERS (for example, this might be reduced to 1 if running MAVLink on very memory constrained hardware).\nIf only one MAVLink stream exists, channel 0 should be used by specifying the MAVLINK_COMM_0 constant.\nReceiving\nMAVLink reception/decoding is done in a number of phases: \n\nParse the incoming stream into objects representing each packet (mavlink_message_t).\nDecode the MAVLink message contained in the packet payload into a C struct (that has fields mapping the original XML definition).\n\nThese steps are demonstrated below.\nParsing Packets\nThe mavlink_parse_char(...) convenience function (mavlink_helpers.h) is used to parse incoming MAVLink data.\nThe function parses the data one byte at a time, returning 0 (MAVLINK_FRAMING_INCOMPLETE) as it progresses, and 1 (MAVLINK_FRAMING_OK) on successful decoding of a packet.\nThe r_mavlink_status parameter is updated with the channel status/errors as decoding progresses (you can check mavlink_status_t.msg_received to get the current byte's decode status/error and mavlink_status_t.parse_state for the current parse state).\nOn successful decoding of a packet, the r_message argument is populated with an object representing the decoded packet.\nThe function prototype and parameters are shown below:\nMAVLINK_HELPER uint8_t mavlink_parse_char(uint8_t chan, uint8_t c, mavlink_message_t* r_message,

NULL if the message couldn't be decoded.\nmavlink_status_t* r_mavlink_status: The channel statistics, including information about the current parse state.\n\nReturns: 0 if the packet decoding is incomplete. 1 if the packet successfully decoded.\nThe code fragment below shows the typical use of this function when reading data from a serial port (serial):\n#include \n\nmavlink_status_t status;\nmavlink_message_t msg;\nint chan = MAVLINK_COMM_0;\n\nwhile(serial.bytesAvailable > 0)\n{\n  uint8_t byte = serial.getNextByte();\n  if (mavlink_parse_char(chan, byte, &msg, &status))\n    {\n    printf(\"Received message with ID %d, sequence: %d from component %d of system %d\\n\", msg.msgid, msg.seq, msg.compid, msg.sysid);\n    // ... DECODE THE MESSAGE PAYLOAD HERE ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n The mavlink_helpers.h include other parser functions: mavlink_frame_char() and mavlink_frame_char_buffer().\n  Generally you will want to use mavlink_parse_char() (which calls those functions internally), but reviewing the other methods can give you a better understanding of the parsing process.\n\nDecoding the Payload \nThe message/packet object retrieved in the previous section(mavlink_message_t) contains fields in the MAVLink packet/serialization format - including the message id (msgid) and the payload (payload64).\nTo get the fields of the specific message in the packet you need to further decode the payload.\nThis is typically done by providing a case statement that maps the ids of the messages you wish to decode to appropriate decoder functions.\nThe code fragment below shows this for two messages (the first decodes a whole message into a C struct, while the second gets just a single field):\nif (mavlink_parse_char(chan, byte, &msg, &status)) {\n...\n\n    switch(msg.msgid) {\n      case MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GLOBAL_POSITION_INT: // ID for GLOBAL_POSITION_INT\n        {\n          // Get all fields in payload (into global_position)\n          mavlink_msg_global_position_int_decode(&msg, &global_position);\n\n        }\n        break;\n      case MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GPS_STATUS:\n        {\n          // Get just one field from payload\n          visible_sats = mavlink_msg_gps_status_get_satellites_visible(&msg);\n        }\n        break;\n     default:\n        break;\n    }\n\n...\n}\n\nThe decoder/encoder functions and ids for each message in a dialect can be found in separate header files under the dialect folder.\nThe headers are named with a format including the message name (mavlink_msg_message_name.h)\n\n Individual message definitions for the dialect are pulled in when you include mavlink.h for your dialect, so you don't need to include these separately.\n\nThe most useful decoding function is named with the pattern mavlink_msg_message_name_decode(), and extracts the whole payload into a C struct (with fields mapping to the original XML message definition).\nThere are also separate decoder functions to just get the values of individual fields.\nFor example, the common message GLOBAL_POSITION_INT is generated to common/mavlink_msg_global_position_int.h,\nand contains the following definitions:\n// Message ID number definition\n#define MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GLOBAL_POSITION_INT 33\n\n// Function to decode whole message into C struct\nstatic inline void mavlink_msg_global_position_int_decode(const mavlink_message_t* msg, mavlink_global_position_int_t* global_position_int)\n\n// C-struct with fields mapping to original message\nMAVPACKED(\ntypedef struct __mavlink_global_position_int_t {\n uint32_t time_boot_ms; /*\nCommand Decoding \nA MAVLink Command encodes a command defined in a MAV_CMD enum value into a COMMAND_INT or COMMAND_LONG message.\nCommand packets are parsed and decoded in the same way as any other payload - i.e. you switch on message id of MAVLINK_MSG_ID_COMMAND_INT/MAVLINK_MSG_ID_COMMAND_LONG and call the decoder functions mavlink_msg_command_int_decode()/mavlink_msg_command_long_decode() (respectively) to get a C struct mapping the original message.\n\n The message types differ in that COMMAND_INT has int32 types for parameter fields 6 and 7 (instead of float) and also includes a field for the geometric frame of reference of any positional information in the command.\n\nTo decode the specific command you then switch on the value of the mavlink_command_int_t.command or mavlink_command_long_t.command field, which contains the particular MAV_CMD id.\nFurther interpretation and handling of the message then has to be done manually (there are no convenience functions).\nAdditional Checks\nThe library have a number of #define values that you can set to enable various features:\n\nMAVLINK_CHECK_MESSAGE_LENGTH: \nEnable this option to check the length of each message.\nThis allows invalid messages to be caught much sooner. \nUse if the transmission medium is prone to missing (or extra) characters (e.g. a radio that fades in and out). \nOnly use if the channel will only contain messages types listed in the headers.\n\nTransmitting\nTransmitting messages can be done by using the mavlink_msg_*_pack() function, where one is defined for every message. \nThe packed message can then be serialized with mavlink_helpers.h:mavlink_msg_to_send_buffer() and then writing the resultant byte array out over the appropriate serial interface.\nIt is possible to simplify the above by writing wrappers around the transmitting/receiving code. \nA multi-byte writing macro can be defined, MAVLINK_SEND_UART_BYTES(), or a single-byte function can be defined, comm_send_ch(), that wrap the low-level driver for transmitting the data. \nIf this is done, MAVLINK_USE_CONVENIENCE_FUNCTIONS must be defined.\nMessage Signing\nMessage Signing (authentication) allows a MAVLink 2 system to verify that messages originate from a trusted source.\nThe C libraries generated by mavgen provide almost everything needed to support message signing in your MAVLink system.\nThe topic C Message Signing explains the remaining code that a system must implement to enable signing using the C library.\nWorking with MAVLink 1 \nThis section explains how to use the MAVLink 2 C library to work with MAVLink 1 systems.\nVersion Handshaking/Negotiation\nMAVLink Versions explains the handshaking used to determine the supported MAVLink version of either end of the channel, and how to negotiate the version to use.\nSending and Receiving MAVLink 1 Packets\nThe MAVLink 2 library will send packets in MAVLink 2 framing by default. \nTo force sending MAVLink 1 packets on a particular channel you change the flags field of the status object. \nFor example, the following code causes subsequent packets on the given channel to be sent as MAVLink 1:\nmavlink_status_t* chan_state = mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0);\nchan_state->flags |= MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1;\n\nIncoming MAVLink 1 packets will be automatically handled as MAVLink 1. If you need to determine if a particular message was received as MAVLink 1 or MAVLink 2 then you can use the magic field of the message. In c programming, this is done like this:\nif (msg->magic == MAVLINK_STX_MAVLINK1) {\n   printf(\"This is a MAVLink 1 message\\n\");\n}\n\nIn most cases this should not be necessary as the XML message definition files for MAVLink 1 and MAVLink 2 are the same, so you can treat incoming MAVLink 1 messages the same as MAVLink 2 messages.\n\n MAVLink 1 is restricted to message IDs less than 256, so any messages with a higher message ID won't be received as MAVLink 1.\n\nIt is advisable to switch to MAVLink 2 when the communication partner sends MAVLink 2 (see Version Handshaking). The minimal solution is to watch incoming packets using code similar to this:\nif (mavlink_parse_char(MAVLINK_COMM_0, buf[i], &msg, &status)) {\n\n    // check if we received version 2 and request a switch.\n    if (!(mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0)->flags & MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_IN_MAVLINK1)) {\n        // this will only switch to proto version 2\n        chan_state->flags &= ~(MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1);\n    }\n}\n\nExamples\nThe following examples show the use of the API.\n\nUART Interface: Simple C example of a MAVLink to UART interface for Unix-like systems.\nUDP Example: Simple C example of a MAVLink UDP interface for Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.).\n\nIn addition, the C library is used in numerous open source systems:\n\nPX4\nArduPilot\nMAVSDK\n\n"},"mavgen_c/message_signing_c.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/message_signing_c.html","title":"Message Signing","keywords":"","body":"C Message Signing (mavgen)\nOne of the key features of MAVLink 2 is support for Message Signing (authentication).\nThe C libraries generated by mavgen provide almost everything needed to support signing in your MAVLink system.\nYou will need to add some code to:\n\nHandle the SETUP_SIGNING message.\nSetup and teardown signing on a link.\nSave and load the secret key and timestamp in persistent storage\nImplement a callback to define which (if any) unsigned messages will be accepted.\n\nSecret Key Management (SETUP_SIGNING)\nA secret key is 32 bytes of binary data that are used to create message signatures that can be verified by other holders of the key.\nThe general requirements for creating, storing, logging and sharing keys are covered in: Message Signing > Secret Key Management.\nThe section Enabling Signing on a Channel below shows how to set the secret key used by each channel.\n\nHandling Timestamps\nThe timestamp is a 48 bit number with units of 10 microseconds since 1st January 2015 GMT. \nThe general requirements for managing timestamps are covered in Message Signing > Timestamp Handling.\nThe library automatically handles some of the rules: \n\ntimestamps are incremented by one on every message send from a link.\ntimestamps are updated to match that of the last accepted incoming message (if it is greater than the current local timestamp).\nmessages are rejected if the timestamp of a message on a channel is before the last message received on that channel.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each MAVLink system to store and restore the timestamp into persistent storage (this is critical for the security of the signing system).\nThe section Enabling Signing on a Channel below shows how to set the timestamp.\n\nEnabling Signing on a Channel \nTo enable signing on a channel you need to fill in two pointers in the status structure for the channel. \nThe two pointers are:\nmavlink_signing_t *signing;\nmavlink_signing_streams_t *signing_streams;\n\nThe signing pointer controls signing for this stream. \nIt is per-stream, and contains the secret key, the timestamp and a set of flags, plus an optional callback function for accepting unsigned packets. Typical setup would be:\nmavlink_signing_t signing;\nmemset(&signing, 0, sizeof(signing));\nmemcpy(signing.secret_key, key.secret_key, 32);\nsigning.link_id = (uint8_t)chan;\nsigning.timestamp = key.timestamp;

i \nHandling Link IDs \nThe purpose of the link_id field in the MAVLink 2 signing structure is to prevent cross-channel replay attacks. \nWithout the link_id an attacker could record a packet (such as a disarm request) on one channel, then play it back on a different channel.\nThe intention with the link IDs is that each channel of communication between an autopilot and a GCS uses a different link ID. \nThere is no requirement that the same link ID be used in both directions however.\nFor C implementations the obvious mechanism is to use the MAVLink channel number as the link ID. \nThat works well for an autopilot, but runs into an issue for a GCS implementation. \nThe issue is that a user may launch multiple GCS instances talking to the same autopilot via different communication links (such as two radios, or USB and a radio). \nThese multiple GCS instances will not be aware of each other, and so may choose the same link ID. \nIf that happens then a large number of correctly signed packets will be rejected by the autopilot as they will have timestamps that are older than the timestamp received for the same stream tuple on the other communication link.\nThe solution adopted for MAVProxy is shown below:\nif (msg.get_signed() and\n    self.mav.signing.link_id == 0 and\n    msg.get_link_id() != 0 and\n    self.target_system == msg.get_srcSystem() and\n    self.target_component == msg.get_srcComponent()):\n    # change to link_id from incoming packet\n    self.mav.signing.link_id = msg.get_link_id()\nWhat that says is that if the current link ID in use by MAVProxy is zero, and it receives a correctly signed packet with a non-zero link ID then it switches link ID to the one from the incoming packet.\nThis has the effect of making the GCS slave its link ID to the link ID of the autopilot.\n"},"mavgen_c/examples.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\n\nUART Interface: Simple C example of a MAVLink to UART interface for Unix-like systems.\nUDP Example: Simple C example of a MAVLink UDP interface for Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.).\n\n"},"mavgen_c/example_c_uart.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/example_c_uart.html","title":"UART Interface (C)","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink C UART Interface Example\nThe C-UART Interface Example is a simple C example of a MAVLink to UART interface for Unix-like systems.\nThe example source code demonstrates how to set up serial communication between Pixhawk and an offboard computer via USB or a telemetry radio, \nhow to put the vehicle in offboard mode, and how to send and receive MAVLink messages over the interface.\nSource code and instructions for how to run the example can be found in the Github repo: mavlink/c_uart_interface_example\n"},"mavgen_c/example_c_udp.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/example_c_udp.html","title":"UDP Example (C)","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink C UDP Example\nThe MAVLink UDP Example is a simple C example that sends some data to QGroundControl using MAVLink over UDP. \nQGroundControl responds with heartbeats and other messages, which are then printed by this program.\n\n The example should work on any Unix-like system (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.). \n  These instructions were tested on a clean Ubuntu LTS 16.04 installation using the default version of gcc (5.4.0).\n\nBuilding/Running the Example\nThe following instructions show how to build and run the example.\n\nInstall MAVLink and generate the MAVLink 1.0 libraries into the mavlink/include directory.\n\n Alternatively you can clone the mavlink/mavlink repository and Download prebuilt headers to the same location.

This module provides simple mechanisms for setting up links, sending and receiving messages, and querying some basic autopilot properties (e.g. flight mode). It provides access to the dialect module used for encoding/decoding/signing via an attribute (mav).\nThere are several main caveats to be aware of when using mavutil:\n\nThe link does not properly handle multiple systems running on the same port. \nIf you need a multi-vehicle network see source-system-filtering.\nThe module is optimised for ArduPilot and some functions may not work properly on other autopilots.\nmavutil is still a relatively low-level MAVLink API. \nIt has limited support for even the most common MAVLink microservices.\n\n\n You don't have to use mavutil but it includes a lot of useful code that you might otherwise have to write.\n  In particular the connection code and methods to filter incoming messages are useful for any autopilot.\n\nThe set of modules in the pymavlink package are listed below:\n\n\\dialects\\v20\\* and \\dialects\\v10\\*: Dialect modules corresponding to each source XML message definition for MAVLink v2 and v1, respectively. \nEach dialect module contains:\nconstants for all enums and enum values defined in the XML file.\na set of constants for message identifiers.\na class for each type of MAVLink message defined in the XML file.\na MAVLink class, which can be used to send and receive messages:\nhas _send and _decode functions for each message type.\nhas methods to check and apply signatures.\nhas lower-level methods for packing and parsing data.\n\n\n\n\nmavutil: MAVLink utility functions for setting up communication links, receiving and decoding messages, running periodic tasks, etc.\nmavutil.mavlink_connection(device, baud, ...) for setting up a link to (initially) listen for messages or send messages on a channel (e.g. udp, serial, etc.). This returns an object representing the connection. You can use:\nthemav attribute for accessing the selected dialect/protocol module to encode and send messages\nsetup_signing() for setting up signing\nrecv_match() for capturing messages with particular names/field values\n\n\nThe connection allows you to do a lot of other useful work: get all parameters, access last message of each type received, get current flight mode or armed state, etc.\n\n\nmavwp: Load/save waypoints, geofence, rally points.\nmavparm: Load/save sets of MAVLink parameters.\nmavextra: Useful functions for converting values and messages (e.g. metres/second to Km/h, eulers in radians from quaternion etc.).\nmavexpression (internal): MAVLink expression evaluation functions.\n\nChoosing the Dialect/MAVLink Version \nChoosing the Dialect/MAVLink version depends on whether you're using mavutil for link management or working directly with dialect files. \nBy default mavutil sets up the link to use the MAVLink 1 ardupilotmega dialect for sending/receiving. \nYou can change this by setting environment variables:\n\nMAVLINK_DIALECT: Set to string name for the dialect file (without XML extension).\nMAVLINK20: Set to 1 (if unset then default to MAVLink 1)\nMDEF: Location of message definition libraries\n\n\n You can also change the dialect by passing its name to mavutil.mavlink_connection() when setting up a connection.\n\nIf you're not using mavutil then you can import the dialect file that you want to use directly:\n# Import ardupilotmega module for MAVLink 1\nfrom pymavlink.dialects.v10 import ardupilotmega as mavlink1\n\n# Import common module for MAVLink 2\nfrom pymavlink.dialects.v20 import common as mavlink2\n\nSetting up a Connection \nThe mavutil module provides the mavlink_connection() method for setting up communication links to MAVLink systems over serial ports, tcp, or udp channels (it can also connect to a file object, which is useful when working with telemetry logs).\n\n The method returns an object that represents a single system, but will collect messages from multiple systems on the link.\n  This is OK for two-system networks, but if you need to connect over a multi-vehicle IP network see source-system-filtering.\n\nThe mavlink_connection() method takes a connection string defining the channel, and some optional arguments for setting the baud rate and other properties of the link (the format of the connection string automatically sets, and may override, some optional arguments).\nFor example, to connect to the standard MAVLink simulator UDP port, and wait for HEARTBEAT messages:\nfrom pymavlink import mavutil\n\n# Start a connection listening to a UDP port\nthe_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpin:localhost:14540')\n\n# Wait for the first heartbeat \n#   This sets the system and component ID of remote system for the link\nthe_connection.wait_heartbeat()\nprint(\"Heartbeat from system (system %u component %u)\" % (the_connection.target_system, the_connection.target_system))\n\n# Once connected, use 'the_connection' to get and send messages\n\n\n The udpin prefix used above creates a socket to listen for a UDP connection on the specified port\n  (this is the normal way to connect an autopilot simulator).\n  The complementary udpout prefix creates a socket that initiates an IP connection:\n  the_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpout:localhost:14540')\n\n\nGenerally the API selects a sensible baud rate for the connection type.\nOther mavlink_connection() parameters you may wish to change include: source_system (default 255), source_component (default 0) and dialect (default ArduPilot).\nConnection Strings \nThe mavutil.mavlink_connection() connection string has the format:\n[protocol:]address[:port]\nwhere:\n\nprotocol (optional): \nThe IP protocol. \nIf not specified pymavlink will attempt to determine if the address is a serial port (e.g. USB) or a file, and if not will default to a UDP address.\ntcp: Initiate a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\ntcpin: Listen for a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\nudpin: Listen for a UDP connection on the specified address and port.\nudpout: Initiate a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\nudp: By default, same as udpin. Set mavlink_connection parameter input=False to make same as udpout.\nudpcast: Broadcast UDP address and port.

(uint64_t)\n    time_boot_ms      : Timestamp (time since system boot). (uint32_t)\n    '''\n\nIf you're using mavutil for link management then the mav attribute provides access to a configured MAVLink class object that you can use for sending messages. \nFor example, to send the SYSTEM_TIME message using a link named the_connection:\nthe_connection.mav.system_time_send(time_unix_usec, time_boot_ms)\n\nOther examples can be seen in Publishing a Heartbeat and  Requesting Specific Messages below.\n\n If you're not using mavutil you will need to create and set up the MAVLink object yourself so it knows about channel that it should use for sending messages (represented by the file attribute).\n\nReceiving Messages\nIf you just want to synchronously access the last message of a particular type that was received (and when it was received) you can do so using the connection's mavutil.messages dictionary. \nFor example, if you're using a mavutil link named the_connection you can do:\ntry: \n    altitude=the_connection.messages['GPS_RAW_INT'].alt  # Note, you can access message fields as attributes!\n    timestamp=the_connection.time_since('GPS_RAW_INT')\nexcept:\n    print('No GPS_RAW_INT message received')\n\nAlternatively can use the mavutil recv_match() method to wait for and intercept messages as they arrive:\ndef recv_match(self, condition=None, type=None, blocking=False, timeout=None):\n    '''Receive the next MAVLink message that matches the given type and condition\n    type:        Message name(s) as a string or list of strings - e.g. 'SYS_STATUS'\n    condition:   Condition based on message values - e.g. 'SYS_STATUS.mode==2 and SYS_STATUS.nav_mode==4'\n    blocking:    Set to wait until message arrives before method completes. \n    timeout:     ? \n    '''\n\nFor example using the_connection set up as before, you can wait for any message as shown:\nmsg = the_connection.recv_match(blocking=True)\n\nIf you instead want to want to just get a particular message with particular attribute values you might instead do:\n# Wait for a 'SYS_STATUS' message with the specified values.\nmsg = the_connection.recv_match(type='SYS_STATUS', condition='SYS_STATUS.mode==2 and SYS_STATUS.nav_mode==4', blocking=True)\nYou should also check that the message is valid before attempting to use it:\nmsg = m.recv_match(type='SYS_STATUS',blocking=True)\nif not msg:\n    return\nif msg.get_type() == \"BAD_DATA\":\n    if mavutil.all_printable(msg.data):\n        sys.stdout.write(msg.data)\n        sys.stdout.flush()\nelse:\n    #Message is valid\n    # Use the attribute\n    print('Mode: %s' % msg.mode)\n\nThe returned object is the subclass of MAVLink_message for the specific message. \nYou can access the message fields as class attributes (as shown for the mode in the above code fragment).\nIf needed, you can query MAVLink_message for information about the signature, CRC and other header information.\nRequesting Specific Messages \nA remote system will typically stream a default set of messages to a connected GCS, camera or other system\n(this default set may be hard coded, and is necessarily limited to reduce traffic on the channel).\nTypically a system can also request that additional information be provided by sending the REQUEST_DATA_STREAM message, specifying the required stream(s) (MAV_DATA_STREAM) and rate. \nThe message is sent using request_data_stream_send() (below arg.rate would be the desired transmission rate)\n# Request all data streams\nthe_connection.mav.request_data_stream_send(the_connection.target_system, the_connection.target_component,\n                                        mavutil.mavlink.MAV_DATA_STREAM_ALL, args.rate, 1)\nPublishing a Heartbeat \nAll MAVLink components should periodically broadcast a HEARTBEAT message and listen for heartbeats from other systems (systems consider themselves connected to another system if they regularly receive a HEARTBEAT from it).\n\n Sending Messages explains how messages are sent.\n\nThe HEARTBEAT message can be sent using MAVLink.heartbeat_send() message in the generated Python dialect file.\nThe method definition is provided below:\ndef heartbeat_send(self, type, autopilot, base_mode, custom_mode, system_status, mavlink_version=3, force_mavlink1=False):\n    '''\n    The heartbeat message shows that a system is present and responding.\n    The type of the MAV and Autopilot hardware allow the\n    receiving system to treat further messages from this\n    system appropriate (e.g. by laying out the user\n    interface based on the autopilot).\n\n    type              : Type of the MAV (quadrotor, helicopter, etc.) (type:uint8_t, values:MAV_TYPE)\n    autopilot         : Autopilot type / class.

For more information see Message Signing > Secret Key Management.\n\n\nSigning using MAVLink Class\nIf you're using the MAVLink class directly, you can use the MAVLink.signing attribute to access a MAVLinkSigning object and set the required attributes.\nThe example/mavtest.py script shows how to do this using an arbitrary secret key:\n# Create a MAVLink instance (in this case on a file object \"f\")\nmav = mavlink.MAVLink(f)\n\nif signing:\n    mav.signing.secret_key = chr(42)*32\n    mav.signing.link_id = 0\n    mav.signing.timestamp = 0\n    mav.signing.sign_outgoing = True\n\n The MAVLink class does not ensure that your link_id or initial timestamp are appropriate.\n  The initial timestamp should be based on current system time. \n  For more information see Message Signing.\n\nSigning using Mavutil\nIf you're using mavutil to manage the connection then you can set up/disable signing using the methods shown below:\n#Setup signing\ndef setup_signing(self, secret_key, sign_outgoing=True, allow_unsigned_callback=None, initial_timestamp=None, link_id=None)\n\n# Disable signing (clear secret key and all the other settings specified with setup_signing)\ndef disable_signing(self):\nThe setup_signing() method sets up the MAVLink object owned by the connection and provides some additional code:\n\nIf link_id is not specified then internally the value is iterated.\nIf initial_timestamp is not set then an appropriate value for current time is populated from the underlying OS.\n\nUsing allow_unsigned_callback\nMessage Signing > Accepting Unsigned Packets and Accepting Incorrectly Signed Packets specify that a message signing implementation should provide mechanisms such that library users can choose to conditionally accept unsigned or incorrectly signed packets.\nPymavlink provides the optional allow_unsigned_callback() callback for this purpose.\nThe prototype for this function is:\nbool allow_unsigned_callback(self, msgId)\n\nIf set as part of the signing configuration then this function will be called on any unsigned packet (including all MAVLink 1 packets) or any packet where the signature is incorrect.\nIf the function returns False the message will be dropped (otherwise it will be handled as though signed). \nThe rules for what unsigned packets should be accepted is implementation specific, but it is suggested the implementations always accept RADIO_STATUS packets for feedback from 3DR radios (which don't support signing)\nFor example:\n# Assuming you already have a connection set up\nthe_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection(...)\n\n# Create a callback to specify the messages to accept\ndef my_allow_unsigned_callback(self,msgId):\n    #Allow radio status messages\n    if msgId==mavutil.mavlink.MAVLINK_MSG_ID_RADIO_STATUS:\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Pass the callback  to the connection (here we also pass an arbitrary secret key)\nsecret_key = chr(42)*32\nthe_connection.setup_signing(secret_key, sign_outgoing=True, allow_unsigned_callback=my_allow_unsigned_callback)\n\n \nExamples\nThere are a number useful examples and complete systems based on pymavlink:\n\nThe pymavlink submodule contains a number of simple examples.\nMAVProxy is a command-line, console based UAV ground station software package for MAVLink based systems. \nIt demonstrates most of the features of using the MAVLink module. \nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy\n\n\nDroneKit-Python is a developer API that builds on Pymavlink.\nIt implements a simpler high-level API for accessing vehicle information and also implementations of some of the MAVLink sub-protocols/microservices (eg. mission protocol).\nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python\n\n\n\nSupport\nPymavlink questions can be raised in the normal MAVLink support channels.\nThe Pymavlink Gitter channel also has an active support community.\n"},"guide/":{"url":"guide/","title":"Guide","keywords":"","body":"Guide\nThis section contains guide material for understanding and using MAVLink, including the different versions and microservices. \nThe topics linked from the sidebar (and listed below):\n\nMAVLink Versions\nMAVLink 2\nMicroservices (sub-protocols)\nMessage Signing\nSerialization\nRouting\nGeneral Telemetry\nOffboard Control\nUAVCAN Interaction\nScripts\nMAVLink XML Schema\nDefining XML Enums/Messages\nDialects\n\n"},"guide/mavlink_version.html":{"url":"guide/mavlink_version.html","title":"MAVLink Versions","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink Versions\nMAVLink has been deployed in a number of versions:\n\nMAVLink 2.0: Current/recommended major version. Adopted by major users early 2017. \nMAVLink v1.0: Widely adopted around 2013. Still used by a number of legacy peripherals.\n\nThe MAVLink 2.0 C/C++ and Python libraries are backwards compatible with MAVLink 1.0 (support both protocols).\nVersion Handshaking and Negotiating Versions explain how to choose which version is used.\n\n MAVLink v0.9 is a pre-release version that is no longer supported. \n  The associated message set deleted in August 2018. \n  Legacy code may be present in generator and test code. \n\nDetermining Protocol/Message Version\nA library's MAVLink support can be determined in a number of ways:\n\nAUTOPILOT_VERSION.capabilities can be checked against the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag to verify MAVLink 2 support.\nPROTOCOL_VERSION.version contains the MAVLink version number multiplied by 100: v1.0 is 100,  v2.3 is 203 etc.\nHEARTBEAT.mavlink_version field contains the minor version number. \nThis is the  field defined in the Message Definitions (version in common.xml for dialects that depend on the common message set).\nThe major version can be determined from the packet start marker byte: \n\nMAVLink 1: 0xFE \nMAVLink 2: 0xFD\n\n\n A MAVLink library that does not support a protocol version will not recognise the protocol start marker; \n  so no messages will even be detected (see Serialization).\n\n\n\n\n While messages do not contain version information, an extra CRC is used to ensure that a library will only process compatible messages (see Serialization > CRC_EXTRA).\n\nVersion Handshaking \nSupport for MAVLink 2 is indicated in the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message by the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag. \nThis is sufficient if the communication link between autopilot and GCS is completely transparent. \nHowever, most communication links are not completely transparent as they either include routing or in case of fixed-length wireless implementations on packetization. \nIn order to also test the link, the MAVLink 2 handshake protocol sends a MAVLink 2 frame to test the complete communication chain.\nTo do so, the GCS sends a COMMAND_LONG or COMMAND_INT  message with the command ID MAV_CMD_REQUEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION.\nIf the system supports MAVLink 2 and the handshake it will respond with PROTOCOL_VERSION encoded as MAVLink 2 packet. \nIf it does not support MAVLink 2 it should NACK the command.\nThe GCS should fall back to a timeout in case the command interface is not implemented properly.\nThe diagram below illustrates the complete sequence.\n\n>Drone: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: PROTOCOL_VERSION in MAVLink 2 framing\n    GCS->>Drone: If ACK: Switches to MAVLink 2\n    Drone->>GCS: Switches to MAVLink 2 on receive\n-->\nSemi-Transparent Legacy Radios\nSome popular legacy radios (e.g. the SiK radio series) operate in semi-transparent mode by injecting RADIO_STATUS messages into the MAVLink message stream. Per MAVLink spec these should actually emit a heartbeat with the same system ID and a different component ID than the autopilot to be discoverable. \nHowever, an additional heartbeat could be an issue for deployed systems. \nTherefore these radios can alternatively confirm their MAVLink 2 compliance by emitting RADIO_STATUS in v2 message format after receiving the first MAVLink v2 frame.\nVersions and Signing\nThe supported MAVLink library implementations enable different MAVLink versions on a per-channel basis, where a channel refers to a particular link in/out of a MAVLink system or component (e.g. a serial port or UDP port).\nAs a result, all connections to other components over a particular channel must share the same MAVLink version. If a system is using signing, then all connections via the same channel must also be signing messages with the same key.\n\n A system cannot use a single channel to connect to signed MAVLink 2 systems, unsigned MAVLink 2 systems, and/or MAVLink 1 components.\n\nCurrently most MAVLink networks are configured to use unsigned MAVLink 2 messages. \nMAVLink 1 is primarily used to allow autopilots to connect to legacy MAVLink peripherals, and this is done via a separate channel.\nSigned networks will need to use a further separate channel to connect to other signed systems. \nThe next section explains how a system/channel should negotiate the version to use.\nNegotiating Versions \nVehicle and GCS implementations will support both MAVLink 1 and MAVLink 2 for quite some time. \nWe would like most users to receive the benefit of MAVLink 2, while still supporting implementations that don't yet support MAVLink 2.\nThe following is meant to capture best practice for vehicle firmware and GCS authors:\n\nVehicle implementations should have a way to enable/disable the sending of MAVLink 2 messages. \nThis should preferably be on a per-link (channel) basis to allow for some peripherals to be MAVLink 1 while others are MAVLink 2. \nIt is acceptable for this option to require a reboot of the flight controller to take effect.\nIf signing is enabled then the vehicle should immediately start sending signed MAVLink 2 on startup.\nIf signing is not enabled and MAVLink 2 is enabled then the vehicle may choose to start by sending MAVLink 1 and switch to MAVLink 2 on a link when it first receives a MAVLink 2 message on the link.\nVehicles should set the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 capability flag in the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message if MAVLink 2 is available on a link. \nThis should be set in the case where the link is currently sending MAVLink 1 packets but MAVLink 2 packets will be accepted and will cause a switch to MAVLink 2.\nGCS implementations can choose to either automatically switch to MAVLink 2 where available or to have a configuration option for MAVLink 2.\nIf the GCS chooses to use a configuration option then when the option is enabled it should send MAVLink 2 on starting the link.\nIf the GCS chooses to use automatic switching then it should switch to sending MAVLink 2 if either it receives a MAVLink 2 message on the link or by asking for the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message to be sent and seeing the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag is set.\n\n"},"guide/mavlink_2.html":{"url":"guide/mavlink_2.html","title":"MAVLink 2","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink 2\nMAVLink 2 is a backward-compatible update to the MAVLink protocol that has been designed to bring more flexibility and security to MAVLink communication.\nMAVLink 2 bindings have been developed for C, C++11 and Python (see Supported Languages).\nThis topic provides links to the main new features in MAVLink 2 and how it is used.\nFeatures\nThe key new features of MAVLink 2 are:\n\n24 bit message ID -

Note that means the timestamp may get ahead of the actual time if the packet rate averages more than 100,000 packets per second.\n\n\nsignature (48 bits)\nA 48 bit signature for the packet, based on the complete packet, timestamp, and secret key.\n\n\n\nSee below for more information about the fields.\nLink IDs \nThe 8 bit link ID is provided to ensure that the signature system is robust for multi-link MAVLink systems. \nEach implementation should assign a link ID to each of the MAVLink communication channels it has enabled and should put this ID in the link ID field. The link ID is especially important where there may be a significant latency difference between different links (such as WiFi combined with a telemetry radio).\nThe monotonically increasing timestamp rule is applied separately for each logical stream, where a stream is defined by the tuple:\n(SystemID,ComponentID,LinkID)\n\n For more information see C Message Signing > Handling Link IDs.\n\nSignature \nThe 48 bit (6 byte) signature is the first 48 bits of a SHA-256 hash of the complete packet (without the signature, but including the timestamp) appended to the secret key.\nThe secret key is 32 bytes of binary data stored on both ends of a MAVLink channel (i.e. an autopilot and a ground station or MAVLink API).\nThis is shown below, where + represents concatenation and sha256_48() is a sha256 implementation which returns the first 48 bits of the normal sha256 output:\nsignature = sha256_48(secret_key + header + payload + CRC + link-ID + timestamp)\nTimestamp Handling \nThe timestamp is a 48 bit number with units of 10 microseconds since 1st January 2015 GMT. For systems where the time since 1/1/1970 is available (the unix epoch) you can use an offset in seconds of 1420070400.\n\n This is a loose definition, as the various update mechanisms detailed below may result in the timestamp being significantly different from actual GMT time.\n\nAll timestamps generated must be at least 1 more than the previous timestamp sent in the same session for the same link/(SystemID, ComponentID, LinkID) tuple.\nThe timestamp may get ahead of GMT time if there is a burst of packets at a rate of more than 100 thousand packets per second.\nA MAVLink-enabled device may not know the current GMT time, for example if it does not have a reliable time source, or if it has just booted and not yet obtained the time from GPS or some other system. \nSystems should implement the following rules to obtain a reliable timestamp:\n\nThe current timestamp should be stored regularly in persistent storage (ideally at least once a minute)\nThe timestamp used on startup should be the maximum of the timestamp implied by the system clock and the stored timestamp\nIf the system does not have an RTC mechanism then it should update its timestamp when GPS lock is achieved. The maximum of the timestamp from the GPS and the stored timestamp should be used.\nThe timestamp should be incremented by one on each message sent from a particular link.\nWhen a correctly signed message is decoded the timestamp should be replaced by the timestamp of the incoming message if that timestamp is greater than the current timestamp.\n The link timestamp must never be updated with the timestamp from an incorrectly signed packet (even if these are being accepted).\n\n\nThe timestamp on incoming signed messages should be checked against the previous timestamp for the incoming (linkID,srcSystem,SrcComponent) tuple and the message rejected if it is smaller.\nIf there is no previous message with the given (linkID,srcSystem,SrcComponent) then the timestamp should be accepted if it not more than 6 million (one minute) behind the current timestamp.\n\n\n For devices that store the timestamp in persistent storage, implementations can prevent race conditions by storing two timestamp values. \n  On write the smaller of the two values should be updated. On read the larger of the two values should be used.\n\nAccepting Signed Packets \nWhen a signed packet arrives it should be discarded if the:\n\nTimestamp is older than the previous packet from the same logical stream - where a logical stream is defined as the sequence of MAVLink packets with the same (SystemID, ComponentID, LinkID) tuple.\nComputed 48 bit signature does not match the signature included in the packet. \nThe timestamp is more than 1 minute (6,000,000) behind the local system’s timestamp.\n\nAccepting Unsigned Packets \nMAVLink libraries should provide a mechanism that allows a system to conditionally accept unsigned packets.\nThe rules for accepting these packets will be implementation specific, but could be based on a combination of a parameter setting, transport type, message type, (in)compatibility flags etc.\n\n All packets that do not meet the system-specific unsigned packet acceptance rules must be rejected\n  (otherwise there is no benefit gained from signing/authentication).\n\nSome suggestions for when to accept unsigned packets:\n\nAccept all unsigned packets based on a system-specific parameter.\nAccept all unsigned packets if the connection is over a \"secure channel\" (e.g. local USB cable or local wired Ethernet cable).\nRADIO_STATUS packets are always accepted without signing (to make life easier for telemetry radios).\nAccept all unsigned packets when in an \"unsigned mode\" (perhaps triggered by a hardware button pressed on boot).\nAccept all unsigned packets until a signed packet is received (unconditionally), then move to the more restricted signing rules above.\n\nAccepting Incorrectly Signed Packets \nMAVLink libraries should provide a mechanism that allows a system to conditionally accept incorrectly signed packets.\nThis feature might be useful for finding a lost vehicle with a corrupted secret key (the GCS could choose to still display position information, albeit ideally with a different \"untrusted\" icon).\n\n A system that is accepting incorrectly signed packets should provide a highly conspicuous indication that the connection is unsafe/insecure. Malformed signed packets indicate a bad configuration, transport failure, protocol failure, or hostile manipulation.\n\nSecret Key Management \nA secret key is 32 bytes of binary data that are used to create message signatures that can be verified by other holders of the key.\nThe key should be created on one system in the network (often a GCS) and shared to other trusted devices via secure channels.\nSystems must have a shared key in order to be able to communicate. \n\n The mavgen C and Python libraries support only one key per link. \n  This is a choice of the library and not a limit/requirement of the protocol.\n  An implementation might instead store a pool of keys, and/or manage keys on a per-connection basis.\n\nThe secret key should be stored in persistent storage, and must not be exposed via any publicly accessible communication protocol.\nIn particular, the key must not be exposed in MAVLink parameters, MAVLink log files or dataflash log files that may be used for public log analysis.\nThe method of generating the secret key is implementation dependent. \nFor example, it could be generated by:\n\nA user-entered string that is then run through SHA-256.\nA random key generator.\n\nThe secret key may be shared to other devices using the SETUP_SIGNING message.\nThe message should only ever be sent over a secure link (e.g. USB or wired Ethernet) as a direct message to each connected system_id/component_id.\nThe receiving system must be set up to process the message and store the received secret key to the appropriate permanent storage.\nThe same secure method can be used to both set and reset a system's key (reseting a key does not have to be \"more secure\" than setting it in the first place).\nThe SETUP_SIGNING message should never be broadcast, and received SETUP_SIGNING messages must never be automatically forwarded to other active MAVLink devices/streams/channels. \nThis is to avoid the case where a key received over a secure link (e.g. USB) is automatically forwarded to another system over an insecure link (e.g. Wifi).\nAutopilots that don't offer MAVLink over USB might create a module that can set the secret key from a command line interface (e.g. the NSH Shell).\n\n We recommend that GCS implementations should generate the secret key and share this with connected systems over a secure link (e.g. USB).\nThe receiving system may be configured to ignore message signatures on the secure channel (i.e. accept all signed, unsigned or incorrectly signed packets), so that it is possible to reset a key that has been lost or corrupted.\n\nLogging\nIn order to avoid leaking the secret key used for signing, systems should omit SETUP_SIGNING messages from logs (or replace the secret with 32 0xFF bytes in the logged message).\nSimilarly, signed packets should have the signature incompatibility bit cleared and the signature block removed before being put into telemetry log files.\nThis makes it harder for potential attacker to collect large amounts of signature data with which to attack the system. \nFurther Information\nThe Message Signing Proposal contains additional information, including:\n\nReasoning behind the design decisions.\nEvaluation of security effectiveness, including resistance to replay and offline attacks.\nAssumptions.\n\n\n Much of this content is derived from

The provided Python, C and C# reference implementations are tested to have the correct field reordering, this is only a concern for custom implementations. \n\nThe only exception to the above reordering is for MAVLink 2 extension fields.\nExtension fields are sent in XML-declaration order and are not included in the CRC_EXTRA calculation.\nThis allows new extension fields to be appended to the end of a message without breaking binary compatibility.\n\n This ordering is unique and can be easily implemented in a protocol generator by using a stable sorting algorithm. \n  The alternative to using sorting would be either to use inefficient alignment, \n  which is bad for the target architectures for typical MAVLink applications, \n  or to have function calls in the order of the variable size instead of the application context. \n  This would lead to very confusing function signatures of serialization functions. \n\n\nEmpty-Byte Payload Truncation (MAVLink 2) \nMAVLink 2 truncates any empty (zero-filled) bytes at the end of the serialized payload before it is sent.\nThis contrasts with MAVLink 1, where bytes were sent for all fields regardless of content.\nThe actual fields affected/bytes saved depends on the message and its content \n(MAVLink field reordering means that all we can say is that any truncated fields will typically be those with the smallest data size, or extension fields).\n\n The first byte of the payload is never truncated, even if the payload consists entirely of zeros.\n\n\n\n The protocol only truncates empty bytes at the end of the serialized message payload; \n  any null bytes/empty fields within the body of the payload are not affected.\n\nCRC_EXTRA Calculation \nThe CRC_EXTRA CRC is used to verify that the sender and receiver have a shared understanding of the over-the-wire format of a particular message.\n\n Changes in message specifications that might make the over-the-wire format incompatible include: new/removed fields, or changes to field name, data type, order, or array length.\n\nWhen the MAVLink code generator runs, it takes a checksum of the XML structure for each message and creates an array define MAVLINK_MESSAGE_CRCS.\nThis is used to initialise the mavlink_message_crcs[] array in the C/C++ implementation, and is similarly used in the Python (or any other, such as the C# and JavaScript) implementation. \nWhen the sender calculates the checksum for a message it adds the CRC_EXTRA byte onto the end of the data that the checksum is calculated over.\nThe recipient calculates a checksum for the received message and adds its own CRC_EXTRA for the particular message id.\nIf the CRC_EXTRA for the sender and receiver are different the checksums will not match.\nThis approach ensures that only messages where the sender and recipient are using the same message structure will be decoded (or at least it makes a mistake much more unlikely, as for any checksum application).\nIf you are doing your own implementation of MAVLink you can get this checksum in one of two ways: \nyou can include the generated headers and use MAVLINK_MESSAGE_CRCS to get the right seed for each message type,\nor you can re-implement the code that calculates the seed.\nAs MAVLink internally reorders the message fields according to their size to prevent word / halfword alignment issues (see Data structure alignment (Wikipedia) for further reference), and a wrongly implemented reordering potentially can cause inconsistencies as well, the CRC_EXTRA is calculated based on the over-the-air message layout rather than the XML order.\n\n MAVLink 2 extension fields are not included in the CRC_EXTRA calculation.\n\nThis is the Python code that calculates the CRC_EXTRA seed:\ndef message_checksum(msg):\n    '''calculate a 8-bit checksum of the key fields of a message, so we\n       can detect incompatible XML changes'''\n    from .mavcrc import x25crc\n    crc = x25crc()\n    crc.accumulate_str(msg.name + ' ')\n    # in order to allow for extensions the crc does not include\n    # any field extensions\n    crc_end = msg.base_fields()\n    for i in range(crc_end):\n        f = msg.ordered_fields[i]\n        crc.accumulate_str(f.type + ' ')\n        crc.accumulate_str(f.name + ' ')\n        if f.array_length:\n            crc.accumulate([f.array_length])\n    return (crc.crc&0xFF) ^ (crc.crc>>8)\n\n\n\n This uses the same x25 checksum that is used at runtime. It calculates a CRC over the message name (such as “RAW_IMU”) followed by the type and name of each field, space separated. The order of the fields is the order they are sent over the wire. For arrays, the array length is also added.\n\nChecksum \nThe packet format includes a 2-byte CRC to allow detection of message corruption.\nThe checksum is the same as used in ITU X.25 and SAE AS-4 standards (CRC-16-CCITT), documented in SAE AS5669A. \nSee the MAVLink source code for the documented C-implementation.\nThe CRC covers the whole message, excluding magic byte and the signature (if present). \nThe CRC includes the CRC_EXTRA byte, which is used to ensure that the sending and receiving systems share a common understanding of the message definition.\n"},"guide/routing.html":{"url":"guide/routing.html","title":"Routing","keywords":"","body":"Routing\nThis topic explains how messages should be routed by MAVLink systems. \nOverview\nA MAVLINK network is made up of systems (vehicles, ground stations, antenna trackers, etc.), which may be composed from one or more components (autopilot, camera, servos, etc.).\nEach system has a network-unique system id, and each component has a system-unique component id that can be used for addressing/routing:\n\nThe system id has a value between 1 and 255. \nThe default autopilot system id is usually 1. Users should allocate unique increasing id values when adding new autopilots to a network.\nGCS systems and developer APIs typically use an ID at the top of the numeric range to reduce ID clashes (e.g. 255). Often their system ID is configurable to allow multi-GCS systems.\n\n\nThe component id is allocated by type and number from MAV_COMPONENT.\n\nMessages can be intended for all systems, specific systems, all components in a system, or specific components within a system. \nThe protocol defines two 8-bit fields that can (optionally) be specified in the message payload to indicate where the message should be sent/routed. If the ids are omitted or set to zero then the message is considered a broadcast (intended for all systems/components).\n\ntarget_system: System that should execute the command\ntarget_component: Component that should execute the command (requires target_system).\n\nMAVLink components are expected to process messages that have a matching system/component id and broadcast messages.\nThey are expected to route/resend messages that are intended for other (or all) recipients to other active channels\n(i.e. MAVLink systems may be connected across different transports, connected by a MAVLink system that routes the messages).\nBroadcast messages are forwarded to all channels that haven't seen the message. \nAddressed messages are resent on a new channel iff the system has previously seen a message from the target on that channel \n(messages are not resent if the addressee is not known or is on the original/incoming channel). \n\n Forwarded messages must not be changed/repackaged by the forwarding system (the original message is passed to the new link).\n\n\n\n Systems should, where possible, forward messages according to the routing rules even if they are unable to process them (e.g. signed messages that cannot be authenticated). Messages that are not supported/understood by the library should be forwarded as though they were broadcast messages (in this case the target system/component ids cannot be read).\n\nRouting Detail\nSystems/components should process a message locally if any of these conditions hold:\n\nIt is a broadcast message (target_system field omitted or zero).\nThe target_system matches its system id and target_component is broadcast (target_component omitted or zero).\nThe target_system matches its system id and has the component's target_component\nThe target_system matches its system id and the component is unknown (i.e. this component has not seen any messages on any link that have the message's target_system/target_component).\n\nSystems should forward messages to another link if any of these conditions hold:\n\nIt is a broadcast message (target_system field omitted or zero).\nThe target_system does not match the system id and the system knows the link of the target system (i.e. it has previously seen a message from target_system on the link).\nThe target_system matches its system id and has a target_component field, and the system has seen a message from the target_system/target_component combination on the link.\n\n\n Non-broadcast messages must only be sent (or forwarded) to known destinations (i.e. a system must previously have received a message from the target system/component).\n\n\n\n Systems should also check for SYSTEM_TIME messages with a decrease in time_boot_ms, as this indicates that the system has rebooted. \n  In this case it should clear stored routing information (and might perform other actions that are useful following a reboot - e.g. re-fetching parameters and home position etc.).\n\nLibrary Support\nC Library (mavgen)\nThe generated code for the MAVLink v1 C Library has no specific support for routing or working with target_system and target_component.\nTo extract this information you will need to use the normal methods provided for reading payload fields, and match on the field names.\nThe MAVLink v2 generator for the C library has been updated to make it easier to get the destination system and component ID from the payload (when these are assigned). \nSpecifically, the mavlink_msg_entry_t structure contains flags to tell you if the message contains target system/component information (FLAG_HAVE_TARGET_SYSTEM, FLAG_HAVE_TARGET_COMPONENT) and offsets into the payload that you can use to get these ids (target_system_ofs and target_component_ofs, respectively). The MAVLink helper method const mavlink_msg_entry_t* mavlink_get_msg_entry(uint32_t msgid) can be used to get this structure from the message id.\n\nMAVLink 2 Routing\nUnsigned MAVLink 2 packets are routed in the same way as MAVLink 1 packets.\nRouting Signed Packets \nSigned packets should be routed in the same way as any other packet.\nIn particular, a routing system should:\n\nnot change the message in any way (including replacing the original signature).\nforward a message according to normal rules even if it cannot be authenticated (or even understand) and hence cannot be processed locally.\n\nRouter Implementation\nThe MAVLink Router created by Intel allows to mix-and-match different IP protocols with serial ports and route MAVLink traffic.\nFurther Information\n\nMAVLink Routing in ArduPilot (ArduPilot DevGuide)\n\n"},"guide/general_telemetry.html":{"url":"guide/general_telemetry.html","title":"General Telemetry","keywords":"","body":"General Telemetry\nMAVLink is designed to support sending continuous telemetry streams including position, velocity, attitude and similar key states of a drone.\n"},"guide/offboard_control.html":{"url":"guide/offboard_control.html","title":"Offboard Control","keywords":"","body":"Offboard Control Interface\nThe offboard control interface allows to send low-level and high-level attitude, velocity or position commands to the vehicle.\n"},"file_formats/":{"url":"file_formats/","title":"File Formats","keywords":"","body":"File Formats\nMAVLink systems often need to be able to store, exchange, or restore MAVLink information, including: mission plans, geofence definitions, rally points, parameters, logs, etc.\nOften the information is defined on one system and used on another (e.g. logs from an autopilot are parsed by analysis tools, missions are created using GCS planning tools and run from a companion computer).\nThere is a defacto standard used in many GCS systems and developer APIs for storing mission information: plain-text file format.\n\n At time of writing there are no MAVLink standards (defacto or otherwise) for: geofence, rally points, parameters etc. \n  There is a discussion about standardising file formats in Issue #989.\n\nMission Plain-Text File Format \nQGroundControl and many other GCS support an older plain-text format for missions. \nThis is not officially part of MAVLink and does not allow rally point or geofence information to be provided.\nThe format is shown below. \nThe first line contains the file format and version information, while subsequent the line(s) are mission items.\nQGC WPL \n           \n\n The spaces between the numbers/fields above are  (i.e. \\t in most programming languages).\n\nFor example:\nQGC WPL 110\n0    1    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n1    0    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n2    0    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n"},"guide/uavcan_interaction.html":{"url":"guide/uavcan_interaction.html","title":"UAVCAN Interaction","keywords":"","body":"UAVCAN Interaction\nThis chapter describes the MAVLink commands and messages that facilitate data exchange between\nthe operator's equipment and the on-board UAVCAN nodes.\nThe primary motivation is to enable the user to configure, monitor, and control the on-board\nUAVCAN nodes via the existing MAVLink connection.\nBasics\nThe general description and specification of UAVCAN is available at http://uavcan.org.\nThe text below will be referring to the following terms:\n\nBridge node - the piece of on-board equipment that bridges the on-board UAVCAN bus and the\nMAVLink connection. This function is often performed by the flight management unit, e.g. Pixhawk.\nRemote equipment - the other end of the MAVLink channel, e.g. the ground control station.\n\nUAVCAN Node Identification\nEvery UAVCAN node has a bus-unique identifier referred to as \"node ID\".\nThe node ID is an integer in the interval [1, 127],\nwhere the value 1 is typically used by the autopilot or some other kind of central controlling unit,\nand the values 126 and 127 are typically used by debugging or monitoring equipment.\nEach unit that is capable of communicating via MAVLink and UAVCAN must use the same number for its\nMAVLink Component ID and the UAVCAN Node ID, otherwise serious inconsistencies may arise.\nTypically, if there is a single non-redundant autopilot, its UAVCAN Node ID and the MAVLink component\nID will be set to 1 (one).\nEvery outgoing/incoming MAVLink message/command pertaining to a given UAVCAN node will have its field\nComponent ID set to the same value as the Node ID of the referred UAVCAN node.\nNode Status Reporting\nNode Status Messages\nIn UAVCAN, the abstract node status information is represented by the standard message type\nuavcan.protocol.NodeStatus.\nIts MAVLink counterpart is UAVCAN_NODE_STATUS.\nThe bridge node should emit the MAVLink message UAVCAN_NODE_STATUS every time it receives\na UAVCAN node status message.\nThe bridge node is allowed to decimate the stream of node status messages in order to avoid\ncongestion of the MAVLink channel, but the resulting frequency of status message emission should not\nbe lower than 1 Hz per node.\nThe remote equipment can monitor which UAVCAN nodes are online by means of tracking the amount of\ntime that passed since the last reception of the node status message for each online node.\nThe remote equipment should consider the node to be offline if its last status message\nhas arrived more than 5 seconds ago.\nExtended Node Information\nUAVCAN nodes are typically able to report some static information that identifies their type,\npurpose, vendor, revision, and such, via the standard service type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nIn this context, \"static\" means that the data is not changing while the node is running.\nThis information can be crucial for many important use cases.\nThe corresponding MAVLink message is UAVCAN_NODE_INFO.\nIts fields are direct mappings of the corresponding fields in the service type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nThe bridge node must emit the message UAVCAN_NODE_INFO in the following cases:\n\nReception of a service response of type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nIn turn, this service must be invoked when the following conditions are observed on the bus\n(please read the UAVCAN specification for a more detailed description of the principles of bus monitoring):\nA new node has appeared online.\nA known node has restarted.\n\n\nReception of the MAVLink command MAV_CMD_UAVCAN_GET_NODE_INFO.\nIn this case, the bridge node is required to emit UAVCAN_NODE_INFO once for every known node.\nIt is also allowed, but not required, to unconditionally emit messages UAVCAN_NODE_INFO at a very low rate,\nin order to guarantee that the remote equipment always has a valid model of the on-board UAVCAN bus.\n\nConfiguration Parameter Management\nUAVCAN defines a set of standard service types that facilitate the management of configuration parameters\non UAVCAN nodes.\nThe respective data type definitions can be found in the namespace uavcan.protocol.param.\nThe UAVCAN-MAVLink bridge does not define any additional messages for configuration parameter management.\nInstead, the following standard messages are used in the regular way:\n\nPARAM_REQUEST_LIST - used to request the list of configuration parameters from the specified UAVCAN node.\nRemember that the UAVCAN node is specified via the field Component ID.\nPARAM_VALUE - used by the bridge node to report the value of a configuration parameter.\nThe node ID is reflected in the field Component ID.\nPARAM_SET -

The message structure/fields and handling are largely unconstrained (i.e. up to the creator).\nMAVLink Commands are defined as entries in the MAV_CMD enum, and encoded into real messages that are sent using the Mission Protocol or Command Protocol. \nTheir structure is defined (they have 7 float parameters or 5 float and 2 int32_t parameters) and handling/responses depend on the protocol used to send them.\n\nThe guidance below provides some suggestions on when one or the other might be more appropriate.\nConsider using a proper message if:\n\nThe required information does not fit into a command (i.e. it can't fit into the 7 available numeric fields).\nThe message is part of another protocol.\nThe message must be broadcast or streamed (i.e. no ACK required)\n\nConsider using a command if:\n\nThe message should be executed as part of a mission.\nThere is an existing mission command that you wish to use outside of missions. \nDepending on the autopilot you may be able to handle the message using the same code for both modes.\nYou're working with MAVLink 1 and there is no free id for the new message\n(MAVLink 1 has a much larger free pool of ids for MAVLink commands than for message ids).\nIt is important that your command message is not missed, so an ACK/NACK is required. \nUsing the existing protocol acknowledgments may be faster/easier than defining another message for acknowledgments.\n\nOtherwise either method may freely be used.\nWhere are the MAVLink XML Files Located?\nThe \"official\" project XML files are stored in the Github repo mavlink/mavlink under /message_definitions/v1.0/.\nMAVLink systems typically fork and maintain a copy of this repo (e.g. ArduPilot/mavlink). The downstream repo should pull common.xml changes (see next section) down from the main repo and push dialect-specific changes back to it.\n\n The official repo is forked and/or cloned into your environment when you Install MAVLink.\n\n\n\n A project/dialect doesn't have to push changes back to MAVLink. \n  However this makes sense if you want to publish your messages more widely, and potentially get them moved into the common.xml message set.\n\nWhere Should MAVLink Elements be Created?\nThe enums and messages that are generally useful for many flight stacks and ground stations are stored in a file named common.xml, which is managed by the MAVLink project.\nThe MAVLink elements supported by a particular autopilot system or protocol are referred to as dialects. \nThe dialects are stored in separate XML files, which typically include (import) common.xml and define just the elements needed for system-specific functionality.\n\n When a MAVLink library is generated from a dialect file, code is created for all messages in both the dialect and any included files (e.g. common.xml), and entries for a particular enum are merged. \nThe generator reports errors if there are name or id clashes between imported messages or enum entries.\n\nWhere you define an element depends on whether it is common or a dialect, and whether the project is public or private.\nElements that are potentially useful for multiple ground stations and autopilots\n\nAdd these elements to common.xml (mavlink/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml) in the Github mavlink/mavlink repo.\nRaise a PR with your suggested changes and discuss with the MAVLink project through that mechanism.\n\nElements specific to a particular MAVLink dialect\n\nAdd these elements to the dialect file in the owning system's fork of the repo.\nRaise a PR with your suggested changes and discuss with the dialect project through that mechanism.\nThe dialect project should then (ideally) push the changes back to mavlink/mavlink. \n\nElements for a private project\n\nIf your enums/messages won't ever sync back to the MAVLink project then define them wherever you like!\n\nCreating a Dialect File\nTo create a new dialect file:\n\nFork mavlink/mavlink for your system and clone to your system\nCreate a dialect file named after your MAVLink system (e.g. flight stack) in message_definitions/v1.0/\nCopy the following text into the new file.\n\n\n\n    common.xml\n    9 -->\n    8\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nThe template assumes that your dialect:\n\nimports common.xml (common.xml)\ntakes its version from common.xml  (which is why the version tags are commented out).\n\n\nUpdate the include(s):\n\nif the dialect is not based on common.xml remove the existing include line\nAdd additional   elements to import additional files/dialects.\n Includes in nested files are ignored.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the version:\nMost dialects should leave the version commented out (i.e. all dialects that include common.xml).\nDialects that are not based on common.xml can uncomment the 6 line and use whatever version is desired.\n The version specified in the top level file is used by default, if present. \nIf it is not present in the file, then a `version` from an included file is used. \n\n\n\n\nUpdate the 8 line to replace 8 with the next-largest unused dialect number (based on the other files in the folder).\nOptionally remove the enums or messages sections if you don't plan on declaring any elements of these types.\nAdd enums or messages as described in the following sections.\nSave the file, and create a PR to push it back to the mavlink/mavlink project repo.\n\nMessages \nMessages are used to send data between MAVLink systems (including commands, information and acknowledgments).\nEvery message has mandatory id, name, and description attributes.\nSerialised packets include the id in the message id section and an encoded form of the message data within the payload section.\nThe name is typically used by generators to name methods for encoding and decoding the specific message type.\nWhen a message is received the MAVLink library extracts the message id to determine the specific message, and uses that to find the appropriately named method for decoding the payload.\nA typical message (SAFETY_SET_ALLOWED_AREA) is shown below:\n    \n      Set a safety zone (volume), which is defined by two corners of a cube. This message can be used to tell the MAV which setpoints/waypoints to accept and which to reject. Safety areas are often enforced by national or competition regulations.\n      System ID\n      Component ID\n      Coordinate frame. Can be either global, GPS, right-handed with Z axis up or local, right handed, Z axis down.\n      x position 1 / Latitude 1\n      y position 1 / Longitude 1\n      z position 1 / Altitude 1\n      x position 2 / Latitude 2\n      y position 2 / Longitude 2\n      z position 2 / Altitude 2\n    \n\nCreating a Message\nMessages must be declared between the  tags in either common.xml or dialect files. \nEach message is defined using  ...  tags (with unique id and name attributes).\n\n The only only difference between messages defined in common.xml or dialect files is they they must use different id ranges in order to ensure that the ids are unique. See Message Id Ranges for more information.\n\nThe main rules for messages are:\n\nMessages must include the mandatory id and name\nThese must be unique across the generated library.\nSee Message Id Ranges below for more information.\n\n\nMessages should (very highly recommended) include a description. \nPoint to point messages must include a field for target_system (exactly as shown above).\nPoint to point messages that are relevant to components must include a field for target_component(exactly as shown above).\nThe total payload size (for all fields) must not exceed 255 bytes.\nAll other fields are optional.\nThere may be no more than 64 fields.\nThe  tag may be added to messages that are still being tested.\nFields:\nmust have unique names within a message.\nshould have a description.\nshould use the units attribute rather than including units in the description. \nEach field should only have one or no units.\nshould use the enum attribute where possible results are finite/well understood.\n\n\n\n\n You cannot rely on generators to fully test for compliance with the above rules. \n  The mavgen code generator tests for duplicate message ids, duplicate field names and messages with more than 64 fields.\n  It does not check for other issues (e.g. duplicate names, or over-size payloads). \n  Other generators may provide better validation\n\nMessage Id Ranges \nAll messages within a particular generated library must have a unique ID - this is important because the id is used to determine the format of the message payload (i.e. what generated method can decode the message).\nFor MAVLink 2, each dialect is allocated a specific range from which an id can be selected. \nThis ensures that any dialect can include any other dialect (or common.xml) without clashes.\nIt also means that messages can move from a dialect to common.xml without any code needing to change.\nWhen creating a new message you should select the next unused id for your dialect (after the last one defined in your target dialect file).\nThe allocated ranges are listed below.\n\n\n\nDialect\nRange\n\n\n\n\nCommon.xml\n300 - 10000\n\n\nuAvionix.xml\n10001-10999\n\n\nArduPilotMega.xml\n11000 - 11999\n\n\nicarous.xml\n42000 - 42999\n\n\n\n\n If you are creating a new public dialect, create an issue to request your own message id range. For private dialects, you can use whatever range you like.\n\nYou should not create messages with ids in the \"MAVLink 1\" range (MAVLink v1 only has 8 bit message IDs, and hence can only support messages with ids 0 - 255). \n\nModifying a Message\nChanging the name or id of a message will make it incompatible with older versions of the generated library. \nAdding or removing a field, or changing the name or type of a field, will make a message incompatible with older versions of the generated library (the generated message decoding method is hard coded with the field number, order, type and position at build time - if these change, decoding will fail).\n\n Message Extensions (see below) allow you to add new fields to a MAVLink 2 message without breaking compatibility for a receiver that has not been updated. Note that you can only add messages, not modify or delete them using this mechanism.\n\nIf a message needs to be changed in these ways then there are several options:\n\nA new message can be created with the desired behaviour. \nAt some point the old message may be marked as deprecated.\nThe message can be updated, and the dialect version number iterated.\n\nFor either case, all users of the message will need to be updated with new client libraries.\nFor a message in common.xml either change requires the agreement of major stakeholders \n\nCreate a PR and discuss in the MAVLink developer meeting.\n\n Before proposing changes to common.xml check the codebase of major stakeholder to confirm impact.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to change the message and field descriptions without breaking binary compatibility.\nCare should still be taken to ensure that any changes that alter the way that the field is interpreted are agreed by stakeholders, and handled with proper version control.\nMessages are very rarely deleted, as this may break compatibility with legacy MAVLink 1 hardware that is unlikely to be updated to more recent versions.\nMessage Extensions (MAVLink 2) \nMAVLink 2 defines extension fields, which can be added to an existing message without breaking binary compatibility for receivers that have not been updated.\n\nAny field that is defined after the  tag in a message is an extension field. \nFor example, the OPTICAL_FLOW has flow_rate_x and flow_rate_y fields that will only be send in MAVLink 2:\n    \n      Optical flow from a flow sensor (e.g. optical mouse sensor)\n      Timestamp (UNIX)\n      Sensor ID\n      Flow in pixels * 10 in x-sensor direction (dezi-pixels)\n      Flow in pixels * 10 in y-sensor direction (dezi-pixels)\n      Flow in meters in x-sensor direction, angular-speed compensated\n      Flow in meters in y-sensor direction, angular-speed compensated\n      Optical flow quality / confidence. 0: bad, 255: maximum quality\n      Ground distance in meters.

Some ideas:\n  - GCS find it easier to index /parse arrays, so consider using arrays for fields that represent sequential items - e.g. port values.\n  - Future proof - don't assume that values will be static forever.\n  - ?\n\n-->\nEnums \nEnums are used to define named values that may be used as options in messages - for example to represent errors, states, or modes.\nEvery enum has mandatory name attribute and may contain a number of entry elements (with enum-unique names) for the supported values. \nThe same enum may be declared in common.xml and multiple dialects.\nThe generated library will merge the entry values, and should report an error if there are any duplicate names.\nA typical enum (LANDING_TARGET_TYPE) is shown below:\n\n    Type of landing target\n    \n        Landing target signaled by light beacon (ex: IR-LOCK)\n    \n    \n        Landing target signaled by radio beacon (ex: ILS, NDB)\n    \n    \n        Landing target represented by a fiducial marker (ex: ARTag)\n    \n    \n        Landing target represented by a pre-defined visual shape/feature (ex: X-marker, H-marker, square)\n    \n\nCreating an Enum\nEnums must be declared between the  tags in common.xml and/or dialect files.\nEach enum is defined using  ...  tags (with a name attribute).\n\n There is no difference between enums defined in common.xml or dialect files (other than management of the namespace). \n\nThe main rules for enums are:\n\nEnums must include the mandatory name attribute.\nEntries are merged for all enums that share the same name.\n\n\nEnums should (very highly recommended) include a description. \nIf enums are merged, only one description will be used (usually the first that is encountered).\nEnums may be marked as deprecated.\nEnums must have at least one enum entry.\nEntries:\nmust have a name attribute.\nThe name must be unique across all entries in the enum.\nBy convention, the name should be prefixed with the enum name (e.g. enum LANDING_TARGET_TYPE has entry LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_LIGHT_BEACON).\n\n\nshould have a value attribute, and if assigned this must be unique within the (merged) enum.\nMissing values will automatically be sequentially assigned (starting from 1, if the first value is not assigned).\n We recommend you assign values because then new entries can be added within the range without breaking compatibility.\n\n\nshould (very highly recommended) include a description element. \nmay represent bitmasks, in which case values will increase by a power of 2.\nmay be marked as deprecated.\n\n\n\n\n You cannot rely on specific generators to fully test for compliance with the above rules.\n  mavgen tests for duplicate names in enums, duplicate names for (merged) enum entries, duplicate values for enum entries.\n\nModifying an Enum\nChanging the name or removing an enum will make any messages that use the enum incompatible with older versions of the generated library.\nSimilarly, changing an enum entry name or value, or removing an enum entry, will make messages that use the enum incompatible with older versions of the generated library.\nCare must be taken when adding a new enum entry/value as this may make the generated library incompatible:\n\nAutogenerated entry values may change\nClient code may not handle new values.\n\nIf an enum needs to be changed then there are several options:\n\nA new enum can be created with the desired entries. \nAt some point the old enum may be marked as deprecated.\nThe enum can be updated, and the dialect version number iterated. \n\nFor either case, all users of the enum will need to be updated with new generated libraries.\n\n Before proposing changes to common.xml check the codebase of major stakeholder to confirm impact.\n\nFor an enum in common.xml either change requires the agreement of major stakeholders\n\nCreate a PR and discuss in the MAVLink developer meeting.\n\nIt is possible to change enum/enum entry descriptions without breaking binary compatibility.\nCare should still be taken to ensure that any changes that alter the way that they are interpreted are agreed by stakeholders, and handled with proper version control.\nEnums are very rarely deleted, as this may break compatibility with legacy MAVLink 1 hardware that is unlikely to be updated to more recent versions.\nCommands \nMAVLink commands are defined as entries in the MAV_CMD enum.\nThey are used to define operations used in autonomous missions (see Mission Protocol) or to send commands in any mode (see Command Protocol).\n\n The schema for commands is documented here.\n\nA typical mission command is (MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT) is shown below:\n    \n      Commands to be executed by the MAV. They can be executed on user request, or as part of a mission script. If the action is used in a mission, the parameter mapping to the waypoint/mission message is as follows: Param 1, Param 2, Param 3, Param 4, X: Param 5, Y:Param 6, Z:Param 7. This command list is similar what ARINC 424 is for commercial aircraft: A data format how to interpret waypoint/mission data.\n      \n        Navigate to waypoint.\n        Hold time in decimal seconds. (ignored by fixed wing, time to stay at waypoint for rotary wing)\n        Acceptance radius in meters (if the sphere with this radius is hit, the waypoint counts as reached)\n        0 to pass through the WP, if &gt; 0 radius in meters to pass by WP. Positive value for clockwise orbit, negative value for counter-clockwise orbit. Allows trajectory control.\n        Desired yaw angle at waypoint (rotary wing). NaN for unchanged.\n        Latitude\n        Longitude\n        Altitude\n      \n      ...\n    \n\nThe rules for MAVLink commands are exactly the same as for other enums.\nThere are a few of additional conventions.\nCommand (Entry) Values \nAll mission command entries must have a value (this is not enforced by the toolchain but, as for other enums, it reduces the chance of values unintentionally changing and breaking other systems).\nEach dialect is allocated a specific range from which entry ids can be selected.\nThis ensures that any dialect can include any commands from any other dialect (or common.xml) without clashes.\nIt also means that messages can move from a dialect to common.xml without any code needing to change.\nDialects can choose any values within their range for any message.\nHowever we recommend that all related commands be kept in the same block of ids, and if there are likely to be more similar commands in future then spaces might be left for new commands. \nThe allocated ranges are listed below.\n\n\n\nDialect\nRange\n\n\n\n\nCommon.xml\n0 - 39999\n\n\nasluav.xml\n40001 - 41999\n\n\nArduPilotMega.xml\n42000 - 42999\n\n\nslugs.xml\n10001 - 11999\n\n\n\n\n If you are creating a new public dialect, create an issue to request your own command id range. For private dialects, you can use whatever range you like.\n\nThere are a number of common and ArduPilot commands that are outside the ranges (e.g. 16, 200, etc.). \nGenerally you would only use these these ranges in order to give a new command an id that is close to related to that of related commands.\nThis can be done provided that the command id value is not used by any other XML file in the mavlink/mavlink repo.\nEntry Names \nAs with other enums, enum entry names should be prefixed with the enum name (i.e. MAV_CMD_).\nIn addition, there are some other \"standard\" prefixes which are used for common types of commands: \n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_: NAV commands are used for navigation/movement commands (commands to go to a particular waypoint or move in a particular way).\nMAV_CMD_DO_: DO commands are used for setting modes, changing altitude or speed etc.\nMAV_CMD_CONDITION_: CONDITION_ commands are used to define conditions before the mission state machine will move to the next item (e.g. a time after reaching a waypoint before taking a picture).\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_: For requesting information from a system.\n\n\n The rules for the above prefixes are flexible; some DO commands might reasonably be NAV commands.\n  Ins some cases a request for information might be a MAV_CMD_REQUEST_ and in others it might be a stand alone message.\n\nParameters (param) \nMessage data is encoded in the param values/attributes. \nStandard Mappings\nParameters (params) must have an index from 1 to 7. \nWhere a command contains position information, this is always stored in: Param 5 (x / latitude), Param 6 (y / longitude), Param 7 (z, altitude). \nWhether the value is local (x,y,z) or global (latitude, longitude, altitude) depends on the command and the frame used (frame often defined in the parent message).\nData types\nThe param data for index 1-4, 7 are always exchanged in a field with size float, while index 5, 6 may also be sent as an int32 (depending on the message used).\nThe implication is that index 5 and 6 should not be used for data that may need to be sent in a floating point value (like a NaN).\n\nReserved/Undefined Parameters \nMany commands do not need seven (or any) param values.\nThese unused parameters can be treated as reserved, allowing them to be reused later if the command needs to be extended.\nA reserved param must always be sent with a (default) value of either 0 or NaN (which will be interpreted by recipient as \"no action\" or \"not supported\").\nIf the param is reused the original default value must still mean \"no action\", so that an updated system can still interact with a system that has not been updated.\n\n Unfortunately this means that a reserved param must have its default value decided when the command is declared!\n  The default value cannot later be changed from NaN to 0 (or visa versa) without potential compatibility issues.\n\nTo declare a param as reserved with default value of NaN you should use the following syntax. \n\n\n Params with index values 5 and 6 should not be given a default of NaN , because if these are sent in a COMMAND_INT or MISSION_INT these parameters are integers (and hence there is no way to represent an NaN).\n\nTo declare a param as reserved with default value of 0 simply omit the param from the definition. This is the default - it is equivalent to: \n\n\nIf you have just one unused param we recommend you simply don't declare it. \nIf you have more than one, you may wish to explicitly define it with default of NaN so that you can extend your command later with ether default. \nGUI Param Attributes\nA number of param attributes are provided as \"GUI hints\". \nThese attributes are used to better display params:\n\nlabel - Label for param in GCS/UI.\nAll words in label should be capitalised (e.g. \"Hold Altitude\").\nunits - SI units for the value.\ndecimalPlaces - Hint to a UI about how many decimal places to use if the parameter value is displayed.\n\nThese attributes help a GCS customise the editing experience (e.g. controls can choose to only offer allowed values).\n\nenum - Enum containing possible values for the parameter (if applicable).\nincrement - Allowed increments for the parameter value.\nminValue - Minimum value for param.\nmaxValue - Maximum value for the param.\n\n"},"messages/":{"url":"messages/","title":"Dialects","keywords":"","body":"\nDialects \nMAVLink dialects are XML files that define protocol- and vendor-specific messages, enums and commands.\nDialects may include other MAVLink XML files.\nA typical pattern is for a dialect to include common.xml (containing the MAVLink standard definitions), extending it with vendor or protocol specific messages.\nWhile a dialect can include any other message definition, only a single level of nesting is supported (at time of writing).\n\n Vendor forks of MAVLink may contain dialect messages that are not yet merged, and hence will not appear in this documentation.\n\nThe dialect files are stored alongside in separate XML files in mavlink/message definitions.\nThe human-readable forms of the XML dialect files are linked below:\n\nASLUAV.xml\nall.xml\nardupilotmega.xml\nautoquad.xml\nicarous.xml\nmatrixpilot.xml\nminimal.xml\npaparazzi.xml\npython_array_test.xml\nslugs.xml\nstandard.xml\ntest.xml\nuAvionix.xml\nualberta.xml\n\n"},"messages/ardupilotmega.html":{"url":"messages/ardupilotmega.html","title":"ardupilotmega.xml","keywords":"","body":"\nDialect: ArduPilotMega\nThese messages define the ArduPilot specific message set, which is custom to http://ardupilot.org.\nThis topic is a human-readable form of the XML definition file: ardupilotmega.xml.\n\n The ArduPilot MAVLink fork of ardupilotmega.xml may contain messages that have not yet been merged into this documentation.\n\n\n\n MAVLink 2 messages have an ID > 255 and are marked up using (MAVLink 2) in their description.\n\n\n\n MAVLink 2 extension fields that have been added to MAVLink 1 messages are displayed in blue.\n\n\ntd {\n    vertical-align:top;\n}\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n   MAVLink Include Files:\n   common.xml\n  \n  \n   MAVLink Include Files:\n   uAvionix.xml\n  \n  \n   MAVLink Include Files:\n   icarous.xml\n  \n  This file has protocol dialect: 2.\n  MAVLink Type Enumerations\n  \n   ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS\n  \n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     1\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_LEVEL\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     2\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_LEFT\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     3\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_RIGHT\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     4\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_NOSEDOWN\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     5\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_NOSEUP\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     6\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_BACK\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     16777215\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_SUCCESS\n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n     16777216\n     \n      ACCELCAL_VEHICLE_POS_FAILED\n     \n     \n     \n    \n   \n  \n  \n   SCRIPTING_CMD\n  \n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     0\n     \n      SCRIPTING_CMD_REPL_START\n     \n     Start a REPL session.\n    \n    \n     1\n     \n      SCRIPTING_CMD_REPL_STOP\n     \n     End a REPL session.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n   LIMITS_STATE\n  \n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     0\n     \n      LIMITS_INIT\n     \n     Pre-initialization.\n    \n    \n     1\n     \n      LIMITS_DISABLED\n     \n     Disabled.\n    \n    \n     2\n     \n      LIMITS_ENABLED\n     \n     Checking limits.\n    \n    \n     3\n     \n      LIMITS_TRIGGERED\n     \n     A limit has been breached.\n    \n    \n     4\n     \n      LIMITS_RECOVERING\n     \n     Taking action e.g. Return/RTL.\n    \n    \n     5\n     \n      LIMITS_RECOVERED\n     \n     We're no longer in breach of a limit.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n   LIMIT_MODULE\n  \n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     1\n     \n      LIMIT_GPSLOCK\n     \n     Pre-initialization.\n    \n    \n     2\n     \n      LIMIT_GEOFENCE\n     \n     Disabled.\n    \n    \n     4\n     \n      LIMIT_ALTITUDE\n     \n     Checking limits.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n   RALLY_FLAGS\n  \n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   Flags in RALLY_POINT message.\n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     1\n     \n      FAVORABLE_WIND\n     \n     Flag set when requiring favorable winds for landing.\n    \n    \n     2\n     \n      LAND_IMMEDIATELY\n     \n     Flag set when plane is to immediately descend to break altitude and land without GCS intervention.

If the system is following the MAVLink standard, the system state is mainly defined by three orthogonal states/modes: The system mode, which is either LOCKED (motors shut down and locked), MANUAL (system under RC control), GUIDED (system with autonomous position control, position setpoint controlled manually) or AUTO (system guided by path/waypoint planner). The NAV_MODE defined the current flight state: LIFTOFF (often an open-loop maneuver), LANDING, WAYPOINTS or VECTOR. This represents the internal navigation state machine. The system status shows whether the system is currently active or not and if an emergency occurred. During the CRITICAL and EMERGENCY states the MAV is still considered to be active, but should start emergency procedures autonomously. After a failure occurred it should first move from active to critical to allow manual intervention and then move to emergency after a certain timeout.\n  \n   \n    \n     Field Name\n     Type\n     Units\n     Values\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     onboard_control_sensors_present\n     uint32_t\n     \n     \n     \n      MAV_SYS_STATUS_SENSOR\n     \n     Bitmap showing which onboard controllers and sensors are present.

The only guarantee on this field is that it will never be reset and is consistent within a flight. The recommended value for this field is the uncorrected barometric altitude at boot time.

The flags message is an integer bitmask containing information on which EKF outputs are valid. See the ESTIMATOR_STATUS_FLAGS enum definition for further information. The innovation test ratios show the magnitude of the sensor innovation divided by the innovation check threshold. Under normal operation the innovation test ratios should be below 0.5 with occasional values up to 1.0. Values greater than 1.0 should be rare under normal operation and indicate that a measurement has been rejected by the filter. The user should be notified if an innovation test ratio greater than 1.0 is recorded. Notifications for values in the range between 0.5 and 1.0 should be optional and controllable by the user.\n  \n   \n    \n     Field Name\n     Type\n     Units\n     Values\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     time_usec\n     uint64_t\n     us\n     \n      \n      \n     \n     Timestamp (UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot).

sequence to upload a mission to a drone (assuming all operations succeed).\n\n Mission update must be robust! \n  A new mission should be fully uploaded and accepted before the old mission is replaced/removed.\n\n\n>Drone: MISSION_COUNT\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: MISSION_REQUEST_INT (0)\n    Drone->>Drone: Start timeout\n    GCS-- >>Drone: MISSION_ITEM_INT (0)\n    Note over GCS,Drone: ... iterate through items ...\n    Drone->>GCS: MISSION_REQUEST_INT (count-1)\n    Drone->>Drone: Start timeout\n    GCS-- >>Drone: MISSION_ITEM_INT (count-1)\n    Drone->>GCS: MISSION_ACK\n-->\nIn more detail, the sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS sends MISSION_COUNT including the number of mission items to be uploaded (count).\nA timeout must be started for the GCS to wait on the response from Drone (MISSION_REQUEST_INT).\n\n\nDrone receives message and responds with MISSION_REQUEST_INT requesting the first mission item (seq==0).\nA timeout must be started for the Drone to wait on the MISSION_ITEM_INT response from GCS.\n\n\nGCS receives MISSION_REQUEST_INT and responds with the requested mission item in a MISSION_ITEM_INT message.\nDrone and GCS repeat the MISSION_REQUEST_INT/MISSION_ITEM_INT cycle, iterating seq until all items are uploaded (seq==count-1).\nAfter receiving the last mission item the drone responds with MISSION_ACK with the type of MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED indicating mission upload completion/success.\nThe drone should set the new mission to be the current mission, discarding the original data.\nThe drone considers the upload complete.\n\n\nGCS receives MISSION_ACK containing MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED to indicate the operation is complete.\n\nNote:\n\nA timeout is set for every message that requires a response (e.g. MISSION_REQUEST_INT).\nIf the timeout expires without a response being received then the request must be resent.\nMission items must be received in order.\nIf an item is received out-of-sequence the expected item should be re-requested by the vehicle (the out-of-sequence item is dropped).\nAn error can be signaled in response to any request using a MISSION_ACK message containing an error code. \nThis must cancel the operation and restore the mission to its previous state.\nFor example, the drone might respond to the MISSION_COUNT request with a MAV_MISSION_NO_SPACE if there isn't enough space to upload the mission.\nThe sequence above shows the mission items packaged in MISSION_ITEM_INT messages. \nProtocol implementations must also support MISSION_ITEM and MISSION_REQUEST in the same way.\nUploading an empty mission (MISSION_COUNT is 0) has the same effect as clearing the mission.\n\nDownload a Mission from the Vehicle \nThe diagram below shows the communication sequence to download a mission from a drone (assuming all operations succeed).\n\n>Drone: MISSION_REQUEST_LIST\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone-- >>GCS: MISSION_COUNT\n    GCS->>Drone: MISSION_REQUEST_INT (0)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone-- >>GCS: MISSION_ITEM_INT (0)\n    Note over GCS,Drone: ... iterate through items ...\n    GCS->>Drone: MISSION_REQUEST_INT (count-1)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone-- >>GCS: MISSION_ITEM_INT (count-1)\n    GCS->>Drone: MISSION_ACK\n-->\nThe sequence is similar to that for uploading a mission.\nThe main difference is that the client (e.g. GCS) sends MISSION_REQUEST_LIST, which triggers the autopilot to respond with the current count of items. \nThis starts a cycle where the GCS requests mission items, and the drone supplies them.\nNote:\n\nA timeout is set for every message that requires a response (e.g. MISSION_REQUEST_INT).\nIf the timeout expires without a response being received then the request must be resent.\nMission items must be received in order.\nIf an item is received out-of-sequence the expected item should be re-requested by the GCS (the out-of-sequence item is dropped).\nAn error can be signaled in response to any request using a MISSION_ACK message containing an error code.\nThis must cancel the operation.\nThe sequence above shows the mission items packaged in MISSION_ITEM_INT messages.\nProtocol implementations must also support MISSION_ITEM and MISSION_REQUEST in the same way.\n\nSet Current Mission Item \nThe diagram below shows the communication sequence to set the current mission item.\n\n>Drone: MISSION_SET_CURRENT\n    Drone-- >>GCS: MISSION_CURRENT\n-->\nIn more detail, the sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS/App sends MISSION_SET_CURRENT, specifying the new sequence number (seq).\nDrone receives message and attempts to update the current mission sequence number.\nOn success, the Drone must broadcast a MISSION_CURRENT message containing the current sequence number (seq). \nOn failure, the Drone must broadcast a STATUSTEXT with a MAV_SEVERITY and a string stating the problem.\nThis may be displayed in the UI of receiving systems.\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThere is no specific timeout on the MISSION_SET_CURRENT message.\nThe acknowledgment of the message is via broadcast of mission/system status, which is not associated with the original message.\nThis differs from error handling in other operations.\nThis approach is used because the success/failure is relevant to all mission-handling clients.\n\nMonitor Mission Progress \nGCS/developer API can monitor progress by handling the appropriate messages sent by the drone:\n\nThe vehicle must broadcast a MISSION_ITEM_REACHED message whenever a new mission item is reached.\nThe message contains the seq number of the current mission item.\nThe vehicle must  also broadcast a MISSION_CURRENT message if the current mission item is changed.\n\nClear Missions \nThe diagram below shows the communication sequence to clear the mission from a drone (assuming all operations succeed).\n\n>Drone: MISSION_CLEAR_ALL\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone-- >>GCS: MISSION_ACK\n-->\nIn more detail, the sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS/API sends MISSION_CLEAR_ALL\nA timeout is started for the GCS to wait on MISSION_ACK from Drone.\n\n\nDrone receives the message, and clears the mission from storage.\nDrone responds with MISSION_ACK with result type of MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTEDMAV_MISSION_RESULT.\nGCS receives MISSION_ACK and clears its own stored information about the mission.\nThe operation is now complete.\n\nNote:\n\nA timeout is set for every message that requires a response (e.g. MISSION_CLEAR_ALL).\nIf the timeout expires without a response being received then the request must be resent.\nAn error can be signaled in response to any request (in this case, just MISSION_CLEAR_ALL) using a MISSION_ACK message containing an error code.\nThis must cancel the operation.\nThe GCS record of the mission (if any) should be retained.\n\nCanceling Operations \nThe above mission operations may be canceled by responding to any request (e.g. MISSION_REQUEST_INT) with a MISSION_ACK message containing the MAV_MISSION_OPERATION_CANCELLED error.\nBoth systems should then return themselves to the idle state (if the system does not receive the cancellation message it will resend the request; the recipient will then be in the idle state and may respond with an appropriate error for that state).\nOperation Exceptions\nTimeouts and Retries \nA timeout should be set for all messages that require a response.\nIf the expected response is not received before the timeout then the message must be resent.\nIf no response is received after a number of retries then the client must cancel the operation and return to an idle state.\nThe recommended timeout values before resending, and the number of retries are:\n\nTimeout (default): 1500 ms\nTimeout (mission items): 250 ms.\nRetries (max): 5\n\nErrors/Completion \nAll operations complete with a MISSION_ACK message containing the result of the operation (MAV_MISSION_RESULT) in the type field.\nOn successful completion, the message must contain type of MAV_MISSION_ACCEPTED; this is sent by the system that is receiving the command/data (e.g. the drone for mission upload or the GCS for mission download).\nAn operation may also complete with an error - MISSION_ACK.type set to MAV_MISSION_ERROR or some other error code in MAV_MISSION_RESULT. \nThis can occur in response to any message/anywhere in the sequence.\nErrors are considered unrecoverable. \nIn an error is sent, both ends of the system should reset themselves to the idle state and the current state of the mission on the vehicle should be unaltered.\nNote:\n\ntimeouts are not considered errors.\nOut-of-sequence messages in mission upload/download are recoverable, and are not treated as errors.\n\nMission File Formats\nThe defacto standard file format for exchanging missions/plans is discussed in: File Formats > Mission Plain-Text File Format.\nMission Command Detail\nThis section is for clarifications and additional information about common mission items.\nIn particular it is intended for cases that are difficult to document in the specification XML, or when images will much better describe expected behaviour.\nLoiter Commands (MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_*) \nLoiter commands are provided to allow a vehicle to hold at a location for a specified time or number of turns, until it reaches the specified altitude, or indefinitely.\nMulticopter vehicles stop at the specified point (within a vehicle-specific acceptance radius that is not set by the mission item).\nForward-moving vehicles (e.g. fixed-wing) circle the point with the specified radius/direction.\nThe commands are:\n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TIME - Loiter at specified location for a given amount of time after reaching the location. \nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TURNS - Loiter at specified location for a given number of turns.\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TO_ALT - Loiter at specified location until desired altitude is reached.\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_UNLIM - Loiter at specified location for an unlimited amount of time, yawing to face a given direction.\n\nThe location and fixed-wing loiter radius parameters are common to all commands:\n\n\n\nParam (:Label)\nDescription\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n3: Radius\nRadius around waypoint. If positive loiter clockwise, else counter-clockwise\nm\n\n\n5: Latitude\nLatitude\n\n\n\n6: Longitude\nLongitude\n\n\n\n7: Altitude\nAltitude\nm\n\n\n\nThe loiter time and turns are set in param 1 for the respective messages.\nThe direction of loiter for MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_UNLIM can be set using param4 (Yaw).\n\n The remaining parameters (xtrack and heading) apply only to forward flying aircraft (not multicopters!)\n\nXtrack and heading define the location at which a forward flying (fixed wing) vehicle will exit the loiter circle, and its path to the next waypoint (these apply only to apply to only MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TIME and MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TURNS). \n\n\n\nParam (:Label)\nDescription\nUnits\n\n\n\n\n2: Heading Required\nLeave loiter circle only once heading towards the next waypoint (0 = False)\nmin:0 max:1 increment:1    \n\n\n4: Xtrack Location\nSets xtrack path or exit location: 0 for the vehicle to converge towards the center xtrack when it leaves the loiter (the line between the centers of the current and next waypoint), 1 to converge to the direct line between the location that the vehicle exits the loiter radius and the next waypoint. Otherwise the angle (in degrees) between the tangent of the loiter circle and the center xtrack at which the vehicle must leave the loiter (and converge to the center xtrack). NaN to use the current system default xtrack behaviour.\n\n\n\nThe recommended values (and resulting paths) are those shown below.\n\nThe vehicle leaves the loiter after it reaches the desired number of turns or time and based on both the heading required and xtrack params.\nA heading required of 1 prevents the vehicle from exiting the loiter unless it is heading towards the next waypoint (if 0 it can leave at any point provided the other conditions are met).\nWith this setting the vehicle can leave at any point in the arc shown, provided it meets the other conditions (e.g. xtrack).\nIf necessary (i.e. it is not in the arc when the other conditions are met), the vehicle will loop back around the loiter before it evaluates the xtrack condition.\n\nThe Xtrack parameter independently defines the path and exit location:\n\nxtrack=0: Exit the loiter circle and converge to the centre xtrack between this and the next waypoint.\nIf the heading required parameter is not set it will exit the loiter immediately.\nOtherwise it will leave as soon as it is heading towards the next waypoint (which may also be immediately!)\n\n\nxtrack=1: Exit the loiter circle and fly/converge to the straight line between the exit point and the centre of the next waypoint (i.e. don't converge to the centre xtrack).\nIf the heading required parameter is set it will exit the loiter as soon as it is heading towards the next waypoint (which may be immediately!).\nIf the heading required parameter is not set it will exit the loiter immediately (note that this exit path does not make much sense unless the heading parameter is set).\n\n\nxtrack=NaN: Exit the loiter using \"system specific default behaviour\".\nThe vehicle must still respect the heading required param.\nUsually this is synonymous with xtrack=0 \n\n\nxtrack=any other value: Exit the loiter when the vehicle heading (tangent) makes the specified angle in degrees to the center xtrack.\nConverge to the center xtrack.\nThe vehicle must still respect the heading required param (some xtrack values may not be possible with this condition true).\nThis allows callers to specify how quickly the vehicle converges to the center xtrack. For example, the image below shows the vehicle exiting the loiter at 30 degrees.\n\n\n\nImplementations\nPX4\nThe protocol has been implemented in C.\nSource code:\n\nsrc/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp\n\nThe implementation status is (at time of writing):\n\nFlight plan missions:\nupload, download, clearing missions, and monitoring progress are supported as defined in this specification.\n\n\nGeofence missions\" are supported as defined in this specification.\nRally point \"missions\" are not supported on PX4.\n\nMission operation cancellation works for mission download (sets system to idle).\nMission operation cancellation does not work for mission uploading; PX4 resends MISSION_REQUEST_INT until the operation times out. \n\nSource code:\n\nsrc/modules/mavlink/mavlink_mission.cpp\n\nQGroundControl\nThe protocol has been implemented in C++.\nSource code:\n\nsrc/MissionManager/PlanManager.cc\n\nArduPilot\nArduPilot implements the mission protocol in C++.\nArduPilot uses the same messages and message flow described in this specification. \nThere are (anecdotally) some implementation differences that affect compatibility.\nThese are documented below.\nSource:\n\n/libraries/GCS_MAVLink/GCS_Common.cpp\n\nFlight Plan Missions\nMission upload, download, clearing missions, and monitoring progress are supported.\n\n ArduPilot implements also partial mission upload using MISSION_WRITE_PARTIAL_LIST, but not partial mission download (MISSION_REQUEST_PARTIAL_LIST).\n  Partial mission upload/download is not an official/standardised part of the mission service.\n\nArduPilot's implementation differs from this specification (non-exhaustively): \n\nThe first mission sequence number (seq==0) is populated with the home position of the vehicle instead of the first mission item.\nMission uploads are not \"atomic\". \nAn upload that fails (or is canceled) part-way through will not match the pre-update state.\nInstead it may be a mix of the original and new mission.\nEven if upload is successful, the vehicle mission may not match the version on the uploading system (and if the mission is then downloaded it will differ from the original).\nThere is rounding on some fields (and in some cases internal maximum possible values due to available storage space).\nFailures can occur if you do a straight comparison of the float params before/after upload.\n\n\nA MISSION_ACK returning an error value (NACK) does not terminate the upload (i.e. it is not considered an unrecoverable error). \nAs long as ArduPilot has not yet timed-out a system can retry the current mission item upload.\nA mission cannot be cleared while it is being executed (i.e. while in Auto mode). \nNote that a new mission can be uploaded (even a zero-size mission - which is equivalent to clearing). \nExplicit cancellation of operations is not supported. \nIf one end stops communicating the other end will eventually timeout and reset itself to an idle/ready state. \n\nThe following behaviour is not defined by the specification (but is still of interest):\n\nArduPilot performs some validation of fields when mission items are submitted. \nThe validation code is common to all vehicles; mission items that are not understood by the vehicle type are accepted on upload but skipped during mission execution.\nArduPilot preforms some vehicle-specific validation at mission runtime (e.g. of jump targets).\nA new mission can be uploaded while a mission is being executed.\nIn this case the current waypoint will be executed to completion even if the waypoint sequence is different in the new mission (to get the new item you would need to reset the sequence or switch in/out of auto mode).\nArduPilot missions are not stored in an SD card and therefore have a vehicle/board-specific maximum mission size (as a benefit, on ArduPilot, missions can survive SD card failure in flight).\n\nGeofence & Rally Point Plans\nArduPilot supports Geofence and Rally points on Copter Rover and Sub using this protocol (for MAVLink 2 connections).\nArduPlane supports rally points and missions.\nGeofence support for ArduPlane is in development (May 2020).\nMAVSDK\nTBD\nDroneKit\nTBD\n"},"services/parameter.html":{"url":"services/parameter.html","title":"Parameter Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Parameter Protocol\nThe parameter microservice is used to exchange configuration settings between MAVLink components.\nEach parameter is represented as a key/value pair.\nThe key is usually the human-readable name of the parameter (maximum of 16 characters) and a value - which can be one of a number of types.\nThe key/value pair has a number of important properties:\n\nThe human-readable name is small but useful (it can encode parameter names from which users can infer the purpose of the parameter).\nUnknown autopilots that implement the protocol can be supported \"out of the box\".\nA GCS does not have to know in advance what parameters exist on a remote system (although in practice a GCS can provide a better user experience with additional parameter metadata like maximum and minimum values, default values, etc.). \nAdding a parameter only requires changes to the system with parameters. \nA GCS that loads the parameters, and the MAVLink communication libraries, should not require any changes.\n\nMessage/Enum Summary\n\n\n\nMessage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPARAM_REQUEST_LIST\nRequest all parameters. The recipient broadcast all parameter values using PARAM_VALUE.\n\n\nPARAM_REQUEST_READ\nRequest a single parameter. The recipient broadcasts the specified parameter value using PARAM_VALUE.\n\n\nPARAM_SET\nSend command to set a specified parameter to a value.

This type conveys the real type of the encoded parameter value, e.g. MAV_PARAM_TYPE_UINT16, MAV_PARAM_TYPE_INT32, etc.\n\n\n\nParameter Encoding\nParameters names/ids are set in the param_id field of messages where they are used.\nThe param_id string can store up to 16 characters. \nThe string is terminated with a NULL (\\0) character if there are less than 16 human-readable chars, and without a null termination byte if the length is exactly 16 chars.\nValues are byte-wise encoded within the param_value field, an IEE754 single-precision, 4 byte, floating point value. \nThe param_type (MAV_PARAM_TYPE) is used to indicate the actual type of the data so that it can be decoded by the recipient. \nSupported types are: 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit signed and unsigned integers, and 32 and 64-bit floating point numbers.\n\n A byte-wise conversion is needed, rather than a simple cast, to enable larger integers to be exchanged (e.g. 1E7 scaled integers can be useful for encoding some types of data, but lose precision if cast directly to floats).\n\nMavgen C API\nThe C API provides a convenient union that allows you to bytewise convert between any of the supported types: mavlink_param_union_t (mavlink_types.h).\nFor example, below we shown how you can set the union integer field but pass the float value to the sending function: \nmavlink_param_union_t param;\nint32_t integer = 20000;\nparam.param_int32 = integer;\nparam.type = MAV_PARAM_TYPE_INT32;\n\n// Then send the param by providing the float bytes to the send function\nmavlink_msg_param_set_send(xxx, xxx, param.param_float, param.type, xxx);\n\nMavgen Python API (Pymavlink)\nPymavlink does not include special support to byte-wise encode the non-float data types (unsurprisingly, because Python effectively \"hides\" low level data types from users).\nWhen working with a system that supports non-float parameters (e.g. PX4) you will need to do the encoding/decoding yourself when sending and receiving messages.\nThere is a good example of how to do this in the Pymavlink mavparm.py module (see MAVParmDict.mavset()).\nParameter Caching \nA GCS or other component may choose to maintain a cache of parameter values for connected components/systems, in order to reduce the time required to display values and reduce MAVLink traffic.\nThe cache can be populated initially by first reading the full parameter list at least once, and then updated by monitoring for PARAM_VALUE messages (which are emitted whenever a parameter is written or otherwise changed).\n\n Cache synchronisation is not guaranteed; a component may miss update messages due to parameter changes by other components.\n\nMulti-System and Multi-Component Support\nMAVLink supports multiple systems in parallel on the same link, and multiple MAVLink enabled components within a system.\nRequests to get and set parameters can be sent to individual systems or components. \nTo get a complete parameter list from a system, send the request parameter message with target_component set to  MAV_COMP_ID_ALL.\nAll components must respond to parameter request messages addressed to their ID or the ID MAV_COMP_ID_ALL. \n\n QGroundControl by default queries all components of the currently connected system (it sends ID MAV_COMP_ID_ALL).\n\nLimitations \nParameters Table is Invariant \nThe protocol requires that the parameter set does not change during normal operation/after parameters have been read.\nIf a component can add parameters during (or after) initial synchronization the protocol cannot guarantee reliable/robust synchronization, because there is no way to notify that the parameter set has changed and a new sync is required.\nIf working with a non-compliant component, the risk of problems when working with parameters can be reduced (but not removed) if:\n\nThe param_id is used to read parameters where possible (the mapping of param_index to a particular parameter might change on systems where parameters can be added/removed).\nPARAM_VALUE.param_count is monitored and the parameter set re-sychronised on change.\n\nParameter Synchronisation Can Fail \nA GCS (or other component) that wants to cache parameters with a component and keep them synchronised, should first get all parameters, and then track any new parameter changes by monitoring for PARAM_VALUE messages (updating their internal list appropriately).\nThis works for the originator of a parameter change, which can resend the request if an expected PARAM_VALUE is not recieved.\nThis approach may fail for components that did not originate the change, as they will not know about updates they do not receive (i.e. if messages are dropped).\nA component may mitigate this risk by, for example, sending the PARAM_VALUE multiple times after a parameter is changed.\nParameter Operations\nThis section defines the state machine/message sequences for all parameter operations.\nRead All Parameters \nThe read-all operation is started by sending the PARAM_REQUEST_LIST message.\nThe target component must start to broadcast the parameters individually in PARAM_VALUE messages after receiving this message.\nThe drone should allow a pause after sending each parameter to ensure that the operation doesn't consume all of the available link bandwidth (30 - 50 percent of the bandwidth is reasonable).\n\n>Drone: PARAM_REQUEST_LIST\n    GCS-- >>GCS: Start receive timeout (any params)\n    Drone->>GCS: Send N parameters with PARAM_VALUE\n    GCS-- >>GCS: Start receive timeout (after each param)\n    Note over GCS: Finish/timeout when no more params received\n-->\nThe sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS (client) sends PARAM_REQUEST_LIST specifying a target system/component.\nBroadcast addresses may be used.\nAll targeted components should respond with parameters (or ignore the request if they have none).\nThe GCS is expected to accumulate parameters from all responding systems.\nThe timeout/retry behaviour is GSC dependent.\n\n\nThe targeted component(s) should respond, sending all parameters individually in PARAM_VALUE messages.\nAllow breaks between each message in order to avoid saturating the link.\nComponents with no parameters should ignore the request.\n\n\nGCS starts timeout after each PARAM_VALUE message in order to detect when parameters are no longer being sent (that the operation has completed).\n\nNotes:\n\nThe GCS/API may accumulate the received parameters for each component and can determine if any are missing/not received (PARAM_VALUE contains the total number of params and index of current param). \nHandling of missing params is GCS-dependent. \nQGroundControl, for example, individually requests each missing parameter by index.\nIf a component does not any parameters then it will ignore a PARAM_REQUEST_LIST request.\nThe sender should simply timeout (after resends) if no PARAM_VALUE is received.\n\nRead Single Parameter \nA single parameter can be read by sending the PARAM_REQUEST_READ message, as shown below:\n\n>Drone: PARAM_REQUEST_READ\n    GCS->>GCS: Start receive timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: PARAM_VALUE\n    GCS-- >>Drone: Re-request parameter value on timeout\n-->\nThe sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS (client) sends PARAM_REQUEST_READ specifying either the parameter id (name) or parameter index.\nGCS starts timeout waiting for acknowledgment (in the form of a PARAM_VALUE message).\nDrone responds with PARAM_VALUE containing the parameter value.\nThis is a broadcast message (sent to all systems).\n\nThe drone may restart the sequence if the PARAM_VALUE acknowledgment is not received within the timeout.\n\n There is no formal way for the drone to signal when an invalid parameter is requested (i.e. for a parameter name or id that does not exist).\n  In this case the drone should emit STATUS_TEXT.\n  The GCS may monitor for the specific notification, but will otherwise fail the request after any timeout/resend cycle completes. \n\nWrite Parameters \nParameters can be written individually by sending the parameter name and value pair to the GCS, as shown:\n\n>Drone: PARAM_SET (param name, value, ...)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout (for PARAM_VALUE)\n    Drone->>Drone: Write parameter value\n    Drone->>GCS: PARAM_VALUE (name, value ...)\n    GCS->>GCS: (optional) Update cache for PARAM_VALUE\n    GCS-- >>Drone: On timeout restart this sequence\n-->\nThe sequence of operations is:\n\nGCS (client) sends PARAM_SET specifying the param name to update and its new value (also target system/component and the param type).\nGCS starts timout waiting for acknowledgment (in the form of a PARAM_VALUE message).\nDrone writes parameter and responds by broadcasting a PARAM_VALUE containing the updated parameter value to all components/systems.\n The Drone must acknowledge the PARAM_SET by broadcasting a PARAM_VALUE even if the write operation fails.\n  In this case the PARAM_VALUE will be the current/unchanged parameter value.\n\n\nGCS should update the parameter cache (if used) with the new value.\nThe GCS may restart the sequence if the expected PARAM_VALUE is not received within the timeout, or if the write operation fails (the value returned in PARAM_VALUE does not match the value set).\n\n\n The command MAV_CMD_DO_SET_PARAMETER is not part of the parameter protocol.\n  If implemented it can be used to set the value of a parameter using the enumeration of the parameter within the remote system is known (rather than the id). \n  This has no particular advantage over the parameter protocol methods.\n\nImplementations\nPX4\nPX4 implements the protocol in a way that is compatible with this specification.\nOnly float and Int32 parameters are used.\nPX4 additionally provides a mechanism that allows a GCS to cache parameters, which significantly reduces ready-to-use time for the GCS if parameters have not been changed since the previous parameter sync.\nThe way that this mechanism works is that when the list of parameters is requested, PX4 first sends a PARAM_VALUE with the param_index of INT16_MAX (in code, referred to as PARAM_HASH) containing a hash of the parameter set. \nThis hash is calculated by computing the CRC32 over all param names and values (see the param_hash_check() in source here). \nIf the GCS has a matching hash value it can immediately start using its cached parameters (rather than having to wait while all the rest of the parameters upload).\nSource files:\n\nsrc/modules/mavlink/mavlink_parameters.cpp\nsrc/modules/mavlink/mavlink_parameters.h\n\nArduPilot\nArduPilot implements an incompatible version of this protocol.\nThe implementation uses the same message types and workflow. \nThe main difference is that ArduPilot encodes data within parameter message value fields (floats) using a normal C cast rather than a byte-wise copy (and expects incoming messages to use the same encoding).\nThis can result in significant rounding errors.\nOther known differences are:\n\nParameter sets can be enabled/disabled during operation. \nThis can invalidate the set of synchronized parameters and make access to parameters by index unreliable.\nPARAM_SET\nparam_type in the message is ignored. The data type is obtained by checking stored type info (via name lookup).\nThe data type is used to constrain and round the received value before it is stored (as a float).\nA PARAM_VALUE is not emitted after the parameter update with the new value (or the old value if update failed).\n\n\n\nSource files:\n\nlibraries/GCS_MAVLink/GCS_Param.cpp\nlibraries/AP_Param/AP_Param.cpp\n\nQGroundControl\nQGroundControl implements this protocol, and works with both ArduPilot and PX4.\nSource files:\n\nsrc/FactSystem/ParameterManager.cc\n\n"},"services/command.html":{"url":"services/command.html","title":"Command Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Command Protocol\nThe MAVLink command protocol allows guaranteed delivery of MAVLink commands.\nCommands are values of MAV_CMD that define the values of up to 7 parameters.\nThese parameters and the command id are encoded in COMMAND_INT or COMMAND_LONG for sending.\nThe protocol provides reliable delivery by expecting a matching acknowledgement (COMMAND_ACK) from commands to indicate command arrival, and result.\nIf no acknowledgement is received the command must be automatically re-sent.\n\n COMMAND_INT is generally recommended when sending positional information as it allows greater precision, and is explicit about the co-ordinate frame.\n  Commands that require float-only properties in parameters 5, 6 must be sent in COMMAND_LONG (e.g. commands where NaN has an explicit meaning).  \n\nMessage/Enum Summary\n\n\n\nMessage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCOMMAND_INT\nMessage for encoding a command (MAV_CMD).

The mesage encodes commands into up to 7 float parameters. The coordinate frame used for positional co-ordinates is implementation dependent. Any command may be packaged in this message, but there may be some loss of precision for positional co-ordinates (latitude, longitude).\n\n\nCOMMAND_ACK\nCommand acknowledgement. Includes result (success, failure, still in progress) and may include progress information and additional detail about failure reasons.\n\n\nCOMMAND_CANCEL\nCancel a long running command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnum\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMAV_CMD\nCommands to be executed/sent in the command messages.\n\n\nMAV_FRAME\nCoordinate frame. Used in COMMAND_INT to specify the co-ordinate frame of any positional parameters.\n\n\nMAV_RESULT\nResult of command, included in COMMAND_ACK.result.\n\n\n\nSequences\n\n>Drone: COMMAND_LONG(confirmation=0)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK\n-->\nIf the command drops the sender should increase the confirmation field:\n\n>Drone:

commands are long running, and cannot complete immediately. \nThe drone reports its progress by sending COMMMAND_ACK messages with COMMAND_ACK.result=MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS and the progress as a percentage in COMMMAND_ACK.progress ([0-100] percent complete, 255 if progress not supplied). \nWhen the operation completes, the drone must terminate with a COMMMAND_ACK containing the final result of the operation: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED, MAV_RESULT_FAILED, MAV_RESULT_CANCELLED).\n\n>Drone: COMMAND_LONG()\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK(result=MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS,progress=?)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start (longer) timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK(result=MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS,progress=?)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start (longer) timeout\n    Note right of GCS: ...\n    Drone->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK(result=MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED)\n-->\nLong running operations may be cancelled by sending the COMMAND_CANCEL message.\nThe drone should cancel the operation and complete the sequence by sending COMMAND_ACK with COMMAND_ACK.result=MAV_RESULT_CANCELLED\n\nIf cancellation is not supported the drone can just continue to send progress updates until completion.\nIf the sequence has already completed (or is idle) the cancel command should be ignored.\n\n\n If another command is received while handling a command (long running or otherwise) the new command should be rejected with MAV_RESULT_TEMPORARILY_REJECTED.\n  What this means is that to restart an operation (i.e. with new parameters) it must first be cancelled.\n\nThe rate at which progress messages are emitted is system-dependent.\nGenerally though, the GCS should have a much increased timeout after receiving an ACK with MAV_RESULT_IN_PROGRESS.\nIf a timeout is triggered when waiting for a progress or completion update, the GCS should terminate the sequence (return to the idle state) and notify the user if appropriate.\n"},"services/camera.html":{"url":"services/camera.html","title":"Camera Protocol","keywords":"","body":"Camera Protocol\nThe camera protocol is used to configure camera payloads and request their status. \nIt supports photo capture, and video capture and streaming.\nIt also includes messages to query and configure the onboard camera storage.\n\n The Dronecode Camera Manager provides an implementation of this protocol.\n\nCamera Connection\nCamera components are expected to follow the Heartbeat/Connection Protocol and sent a constant flow of heartbeats (nominally at 1Hz).\nEach camera must use a different pre-defined camera component ID: MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA to MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA6.\nThe first time a heartbeat is detected from a new camera, a GCS (or other receiving system) should start the Camera Identification process.\n\n If a receiving system stops receiving heartbeats from the camera it is assumed to be disconnected, and should be removed from the list of available cameras. \n  If heartbeats are again detected, the camera identification process below must be restarted from the beginning.\n\nBasic Camera Operations\nThe CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags provides information about camera capabilities.\nIt contains a bitmap of CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS values that tell the GCS if the camera supports still image capture, video capture, or video streaming, and if it needs to be in a certain mode for capture, etc.\nCamera Identification \nThe camera identification operation identifies all the available cameras and determines their capabilities.\n\n Camera identification must be carried out before all other operations!\n\nThe first time a heartbeat is received from a new camera component, the GCS will send it a MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION message. \nThe camera will then respond with the a COMMAND_ACK message containing a result.\nOn success (result is MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED) the camera component must then send a CAMERA_INFORMATION message.\n\n>GCS: HEARTBEAT [cmp id: MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA] (first) \n    GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK\n    Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED send info.\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_INFORMATION\n-->\nThe operation follows the normal Command Protocol rules for command/acknowledgment (if no COMMAND_ACK response is received for MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION the command will be re-sent a number of times before failing).\nIf CAMERA_INFORMATION is not received after receiving an ACK with MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED, the protocol assumes the message was lost, and the cycle of sending MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION is repeated. \nIf CAMERA_INFORMATION is still not received after three cycle repeats, the GCS may assume that the camera is not supported.\nThe CAMERA_INFORMATION response contains the bare minimum information about the camera and what it can or cannot do.\nThis is sufficient for basic image and/or video capture.\nIf a camera provides finer control over its settings CAMERA_INFORMATION.cam_definition_uri will include a URI to a Camera Definition File.\nIf this URI exists, the GCS will request it, parse it and prepare the UI for the user to control the camera settings.\n\n A GCS that implements this protocol is expected to support both HTTP (http://) and MAVLink FTP (mavlinkftp://) URIs for download of the camera definition file. \n  If the camera provides an HTTP or MAVLink FTP interface, the definition file can be hosted on the camera itself. \n  Otherwise, it can be hosted anywhere (on any reachable server).\n\nThe CAMERA_INFORMATION.cam_definition_version field should provide a version for the definition file, allowing the GCS to cache it. \nOnce downloaded, it would only be requested again if the version number changes.\nIf a vehicle has more than one camera, each camera will have a different component ID and send its own heartbeat. \nThe GCS should create multiple instances of a camera controller based on the component ID of each camera. \nAll commands are sent to a specific camera by addressing the command to a specific component ID.\nCamera Modes\nSome cameras must be in a certain mode for still and/or video capture.\nThe GCS can determine if it needs to make sure the camera is in the proper mode prior to sending a start capture (image or video) command by checking whether the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_MODES bit is set true in CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags.\nIn addition, some cameras can capture images in any mode but with different resolutions. \nFor example, a 20 megapixel camera would take a full resolution image when set to CAMERA_MODE_IMAGE but only at the current video resolution if it is set to CAMERA_MODE_VIDEO. \nTo get the current mode, the GCS would send a MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS command.\nThe camera component will then respond with the a COMMAND_ACK message containing a result.\nOn success (COMMAND_ACK.result is MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED) the camera must then send a CAMERA_SETTINGS message.\nThe current mode is the CAMERA_SETTINGS.mode_id field.\nThe sequence is shown below:\n\n>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_SETTINGS\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK\n    Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED send info.\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_SETTINGS\n-->\n\n Command acknowledgment and message resending is handled in the same way as for camera identification\n  (if a successful ACK is received the camera will expect the CAMERA_SETTINGS message, and repeat the cycle - up to 3 times - until it is received).\n\nTo set the camera to a specific mode, the GCS would send the MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE command with the appropriate mode.\nThe sequence is shown below:\n\n>Camera: MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: COMMAND_ACK\n    Note over Camera,GCS: If MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED, mode was changed.\n-->\n\n The operation follows the normal Command Protocol rules for command/acknowledgment.\n\nStorage Status\nBefore capturing images and/or videos, a GCS should query the storage status to determine if the camera has enough free space for these operations (and provide the user with feedback as to the current storage status). \nThe GCS will send the MAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION command and it expects a STORAGE_INFORMATION response. \nFor formatting (or erasing depending on your implementation), the GCS will send a MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT command.\nCamera Capture Status\nIn addition to querying about storage status, the GCS will also request the current Camera Capture Status in order to provide the user with proper UI indicators.\nThe GCS will send a MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS command and it expects a CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS response.\nStill Image Capture\nA camera supports still image capture if the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_IMAGE bit is set in CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags.\nA GCS/MAVLink app uses the MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE command to request that the camera capture a specified number of images (or forever), and the duration between them.\nThe camera immediately returns the normal command acknowledgment (MAV_RESULT).\nEach time an image is captured, the camera broadcasts a CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED message.\nThis message not only tells the GCS the image was captured, it is also intended for geo-tagging.\n\n The camera must iterate CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED.image_index and the counter used in CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS.image_count for every new image capture (these values iterate until explicitly cleared using MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT).\n  The index and total image count can be used to re-request missing images (e.g. images captured when the vehicle was out of telmetry range).\n\nThe MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE command can optionally be sent to stop an image capture sequence (this is needed if image capture has been set to continue forever).\nThe still image capture message sequence for missions (as described above) is shown below:\n\n>Camera: MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE (interval, count/forever)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED\n    Note over Camera,GCS: Camera start capture of \"count\" images at \"interval\"\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED  (broadcast)\n    Camera->>GCS: ...\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED (broadcast)\n    Note over Camera,GCS: (Optional) Stop capture\n    GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED\n-->\nThe message sequence for interactive user-initiated image capture through a GUI is slightly different.\nIn this case the GCS should:\n\nConfirm that the camera is ready to take images before allowing the user to request image capture.\nIt does this by by sending MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS.\nThe camera should return a MAV_RESULT and then CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS.\nThe GCS should check that the status is \"Idle\" before enabling camera capture in the GUI.\n\n\nSend MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE specifying a single image (only).\n\nThe sequence is as shown below:\n\n>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS (status)\n    Note over Camera,GCS: Repeat until status is IDLE\n    GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE (interval, count/forever)\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED\n    Note over Camera,GCS: Camera start capture of 1 image\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED  (broadcast)\n-->\nRequest Lost CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED Messages \nThe camera broadcasts a CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED every time a new image is captured, iterating both the current image index (CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED.image_index) and the total image count (CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS.image_count).\nThese messages can be lost during transmission; for example if the vehicle is out of data-link range of the ground stations.\nLost image capture messages can be detected by comparing GCS and camera image counts. \nIndividual entries can be requested using MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE, where param1=\"MAVLINK_MSG_ID_CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED\" and param2=\"the index of the missing image\".\nThe camera image log iterates \"forever\" (but may be explicitly reset using MAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT.param3=1).\nVideo Capture\nA camera supports video capture if the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_CAPTURE_VIDEO bit is set in CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags.\nTo start recording videos, the GCS uses the MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE command. \nIf requested, the CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS message is sent to the GCS at a set interval.\nTo stop recording, the GCS uses the MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE command.\nVideo Streaming \n\n The GCS should already have identified all connected cameras by their heartbeat and followed the Camera Identification steps to get CAMERA_INFORMATION for every camera.\n\nA camera is capable of streaming video if it sets the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM bit set in CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags.\nThe sequence for requesting all video streams from a particular camera is shown below:\n\nin CAMERA_INFORMATION.flagsrequest all streams.\n    GCS->>Camera: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION ( param1=0 )\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Camera->>GCS: MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED\n    Note over Camera,GCS: Camera sends information for all streams.\n    Camera->>GCS: VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION (1)\n    Camera->>GCS: ...\n    Camera->>GCS: VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION (n)\n-->\nThe steps are:\n\nGCS follows the Camera Identification steps to get CAMERA_INFORMATION for every camera.\nGCS checks if CAMERA_INFORMATION.flags contains the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM flag.\nIf so, the GCS sends the MAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION message to the camera requesting the video streaming configuration for all streams - param1=0).\n A GCS can also request information for a particular stream by setting its id in param1.\n\n\nCamera returns a VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION message for the specified stream or all streams it supports.\n\n\n If your camera only provides video streaming and nothing else (no camera features), the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM flag is the only flag you need to set. \n  The GCS will then provide video streaming support and skip camera control.\n\nBattery Status\nCamera components that are powered from their own battery should publish BATTERY_STATUS messages.\nOther components like a GCS will typically only use the camera BATTERY_STATUS.battery_remaining field (or possibly time_remaining); generally other fields can be set as \"not supported\".\nMessage/Enum Summary\n\n\n\nMessage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_INFORMATION\nSend command to request CAMERA_INFORMATION.\n\n\nCAMERA_INFORMATION\nBasic information about camera including supported

information.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE\nSend command to set CAMERA_MODE.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION\nSend command to request VIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION. This is sent once for each camera when a camera is detected and it has set the CAMERA_CAP_FLAGS_HAS_VIDEO_STREAM flag within the CAMERA_INFORMATION message flags field.\n\n\nVIDEO_STREAM_INFORMATION\nInformation defining a video stream configuration. If a camera has more than one video stream, it would send one of this for each video stream, with their specific configuration. Each stream must have its own, unique stream_id.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_VIDEO_STREAM_STATUS\nSend command to request VIDEO_STREAM_STATUS. This is sent whenever there is a mode change (when MAV_CMD_SET_CAMERA_MODE is sent.) It allows the camera to update the stream configuration when a camera mode change occurs.\n\n\nVIDEO_STREAM_STATUS\nInformation updating a video stream configuration. \n\n\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_STORAGE_INFORMATION\nSend command to request STORAGE_INFORMATION.\n\n\nSTORAGE_INFORMATION\nStorage information (e.g. number and type of storage devices, total/used/available capacity, read/write speeds).\n\n\nMAV_CMD_STORAGE_FORMAT\nSend command to format the specified storage device.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS\nSend command to request CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS.\n\n\nCAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS\nCamera capture status, including current capture type (if any), capture interval, available capacity.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE\nSend command to start image capture, specifying the duration between captures and total number of images to capture.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE\nSend command to stop image capture.\n\n\nCAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED\nInformation about image captured (returned to GPS every time an image is captured). \n\n\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE\nSend command to start video capture, specifying the frequency that CAMERA_CAPTURE_STATUS messages should be sent while recording.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE\nSend command to stop video capture.\n\n\nCAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED\nInformation about image captured (returned to GPS every time an image is captured). \n\n\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_STREAMING\nSend command to start video streaming for the given Stream ID (stream_id.) This is mostly for streaming protocols that push a stream. If your camera uses a connection based streaming configuration (RTSP, TCP, etc.), you may ignore it if you don't need it but note that you still must ACK the command, like all MAV_CMD_XXX commands. When using a connection based streaming configuration, the GCS will connect the stream from its side. When a camera offers more than one stream and the user switches from one stream to another, the GCS will send a MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_STREAMING command targeting the current Stream ID followed by a MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_STREAMING targeting the newly selected Stream ID.\n\n\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_STREAMING\nSend command to stop video streaming for the given Stream ID (stream_id.) This is mostly for streaming protocols that push a stream. If your camera uses a connection based streaming configuration (RTSP, TCP, etc.), you may ignore it if you don't need it but note that you still must ACK the command, like all MAV_CMD_XXX commands. When using a connection based streaming configuration, the GCS will disconnect the stream from its side. When a camera offers more than one stream and the user switches from one stream to another, the GCS will send a MAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_STREAMING command targeting the current Stream ID followed by a MAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_STREAMING targeting the newly selected Stream ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnum\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCAMERA_CAP_FLAGS\nCamera capability flags (Bitmap).

Within the XML file, these are defined as:\n\nbool (internally treated as a uint8)\nuint8\nint8\nuint16\nint16\nuint32\nint32\nuint64\nint64\nfloat\ndouble\ncustom\n\nThe custom type is a special case that allows for arbitrary data structures of up to 128 bytes. However these are not supported by default - you would need to extend or write your own camera controller within the GCS to interpret this type.\nParameter Definition\nThe simplest parameter would be a boolean type, which inherently (and automatically) only provides two options (on/off):\n\n    Enable IR Lock\n\n\nThe name attribute is the name of the parameter. This is the name used when requesting or setting the parameter's value using the extended parameter messages.\nThe description is what is shown to the user.\nMore common are parameters that provide options:\n\n    White Balance Mode\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nIn this case, the GCS will automatically build a drop down list with the options defined within the options group. When sending/receiving the options, the value field is used and it is not in any way interpreted by the GCS. The name field is used for display only. In other words, using the example above, when the user selects Sunset, the GCS will send a PARAM_EXT_SET message with the id CAM_WBMODE and a uint32 value of 3.\nCommon Parameters\nCommon Parameters are reserved parameter names for which the GCS can build specific UI controls (if found in a camera definition). \n\n These parameters are common to many cameras (though their valid options vary considerably).\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCAM_APERTURE\nAperture\n\n\nCAM_EV\nExposure Compensation (usually only used for automatic exposure modes)\n\n\nCAM_EXPMODE\nExposure Mode (Manual, Auto, Program Auto, Aperture Priority, etc.)\n\n\nCAM_ISO\nISO\n\n\nCAM_METERING\nMetering Mode\n\n\nCAM_SHUTTERSPD\nShutter speed\n\n\nCAM_VIDRES\nVideo Resolution (for video capture)\n\n\nCAM_WBMODE\nWhite Balance Mode\n\n\n\nExclusion Rules\nSome parameters are only relevant when some other parameter is set to some specific option. For example, shutter speed, aperture and ISO would only be available when the camera is set to manual exposure mode and not shown when the camera is set to auto exposure mode. Conversely, EV (Exposure Compensation) is only used when the camera is set to auto and hidden otherwise. To specify this behavior, you would use the exclusion element:\n\n    Exposure Mode\n    \n        \n            \n                CAM_APERTURE\n                CAM_ISO\n                CAM_SHUTTERSPD\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                CAM_EV\n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThe above example describes an Exposure Mode parameter and its two options: Auto and Manual. When the option is set to Auto, the CAM_APERTURE, CAM_ISO and CAM_SHUTTERSPD parameters (defined elsewhere in the parameter list) are hidden from the UI as they are not applicable. On the other hand, if the option is set to Manual, the CAM_EV parameter is hidden as it is not applicable while the camera is in Manual Exposure Mode.\nRequired Option Updates\nThere are cases where an option change requires a parameter to be updated. For example, using the example above, when the camera is set to Auto Exposure Mode, it internally might change the Aperture, ISO and Shutter speed. When the user switches back to Manual Exposure Mode, the GCS must request an update for the current Aperture, ISO and Shutter speed as they may have changed. To do this, you would use the update element:\n\n    Exposure Mode\n    \n        CAM_APERTURE\n        CAM_ISO\n        CAM_SHUTTERSPD\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                CAM_APERTURE\n                CAM_ISO\n                CAM_SHUTTERSPD\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                CAM_EV\n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis tells the GCS that when the CAM_EXPMODE parameter changes, the CAM_APERTURE, CAM_SHUTTERSPD and the CAM_ISO parameters must be updated (requested from the camera).\nRange Limit\nSuppose your camera has the following ISO options:\n\n    ISO\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nBut this full range is only available when in Photo Mode. For whatever reason, when the camera is set to Video Mode, only a subset of the above range is valid. In this case, you would use the parameterrange element:\n\n    Camera Mode\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis indicates to the GCS that when the CAM_MODE parameter is set to Video, only the given range for the CAM_ISO parameter is valid. It additionally gives a condition that this is only the case when the CAM_EXPOSURE mode is set to Manual (1).\nThis example also tells the GCS not to display this parameter to the user (control=“0”). Camera Mode is a standard parameter defined in the CAMERA_INFORMATION message and it’s handled by the GCS in that way. The parameter definition above was created in order to tell the GCS the rules that are applied when changes to the camera mode occur.\nLocalization\nThe localization element is used for defining localized strings for display to users. If found, the GCS will use to replace all description and options name values found in the file with the strings defined here. Here is an example for German localization (de_DE):\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWhen the GCS loads and parses the XML file, it will check and see if it can find a localized version appropriate to the system language. If it finds a localisation, it will proceed to replace all occurrences of original with translated. If something is not found, the default English string is used. You can have as many locales as deemed necessary.\nProtocol Definition\nOnce the Camera Definition File is loaded by the GCS, it will request all parameters from the camera using the PARAM_EXT_REQUEST_LIST message. In response, the camera will send back all parameters using the PARAM_EXT_VALUE message.\nWhen the user makes a selection, the GCS will send the new option using the PARAM_EXT_SET message and it will expect in response a PARAM_EXT_ACK message.\nWhen the GCS requires a current option for a given parameter, it will use the PARAM_EXT_REQUEST_READ message and it will expect in response a PARAM_EXT_VALUE message.\nFull Camera Definition File Example \n\n\n    \n        T100\n        Foo Industries\n    \n    \n        \n        \n            Camera Mode\n            \n            \n
