Developer Guide\n\nMAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components).\nMAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as topics while configuration sub-protocols such as the mission protocol or parameter protocol are point-to-point with retransmission.\nMessages are defined within XML files.\nEach XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system, also referred to as a \"dialect\". \nThe reference message set that is implemented by most ground control stations and autopilots is defined in common.xml (most dialects build on top of this definition).\nCode generators create software libraries for specific programming languages from these XML message definitions, which can then be used by drones, ground control stations, and other MAVLink systems to communicate.\nThe generated libraries are typically MIT-licensed, and can therefore be used without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.\n\n The C reference implementation is a header-only library that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. \n  It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.\n\nMAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a significant number of contributors.\nKey Features\n\nVery efficient. MAVLink 1 has just 8 bytes overhead per packet, including start sign and packet drop detection. MAVLink 2 has just 14 bytes of overhead (but is a much more secure and extensible protocol).\nBecause MAVLink doesn't require any additional framing it is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth.\nVery reliable. MAVLink has been used since 2009 to communicate between many different vehicles, ground stations (and other nodes) over varied and challenging communication channels (high latency/noise). It provides methods for detecting packet drops, corruption, and for packet authentication.\nMany different programming languages can be used, running on numerous microcontrollers/operating systems (including ARM7, ATMega, dsPic, STM32 and Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS).\nAllows up to 255 concurrent systems on the network (vehicles, ground stations, etc.)\nEnables both offboard and onboard communications (e.g. between a GCS and drone, and between drone autopilot and MAVLink enabled drone camera).\n\nLanguage/Generator List \nThe sections below lists MAVLink generators and their associated programming languages.\nMAVLink Project Generators/Languages\nThe MAVLink organisation provides (and supports) the mavgen, mavgenerate and rust-mavlink tools.\n\n\n\nLanguage\nGenerator\nMAVLink v1\nMAVLink 2\nSigning\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nC\nmavgen\n✓\n✓\n✓\nThis is the MAVLink project reference implementation.

MAVLink 1 has just 8 bytes overhead per packet, including start sign and packet drop detection. MAVLink 2 has just 14 bytes of overhead (27 if signing is used), but is now a much more extensible protocol.\n\n  How many vehicles does MAVLink support?\n  255 vehicles, with system IDs ranging from 1 to 255 (0 is not a valid vehicle ID).\n    Note: Strictly speaking MAVLink supports 255 concurrent systems, and these can include a mix of vehicles, GCS, antenna trackers and other hardware.\n\n  Where can I use MAVLink?\n  MAVLink has been shown to work on multiple microcontrollers and operating systems, including ARM7, ATMega, dsPic, STM32 and Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS.\n\n  How reliable is MAVLink?\n  Very. MAVLink has been used since 2009 to communicate between many different vehicles, ground stations (and other nodes) over varied and challenging communication channels (high latency/noise). It provides methods for detecting packet drops, and the well-established ITU X.25 checksum for packet corruption detection.\n\n  How secure is MAVLink?\n  MAVLink provides message signing, which allows systems to authenticate that messages are from a trusted source. MAVLink does not provide message encryption.  \n  \n\n  What version of MAVLink should I use?\n  You should use the MAVLink 2 protocol where at all possible (it fixes a number of limitations of earlier versions). \n  The MAVLink 2 libraries also support MAVLink 1, so you can use them to communicate with legacy systems if needed. \n  \n\n How often is MAVLink updated/released?\n  \n\n\n  \n    The underlying over-the-wire format is rarely updated (we're only up to MAVLink 2, which was introduced in 2017).\n    \n    New messages/microservices are frequently added. This is a backwards compatible change, and users are expected to regularly update their libraries to support new messages.\n    Messages are rarely modified (or removed) such that they would become incompatible. If this is needed the project will update the MAVLink minor version number and notify users through the mailing list (users can also query the version in code).\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n  Can I use MAVLink in a closed source application without copyright issues?\n  Yes, without any limitations. The generated MAVLink library headers are made available under the *MIT license* (for more information see: Introduction > License).\n  \n\n  How does MAVLink detect and decode messages in the byte stream?\n  MAVLink waits for the packet start sign, then reads the packet length and matches the checksum after n bytes. If the checksum matches, it returns the decoded packet and waits again for the start sign. If bytes are altered or lost, it will drop the current message and continue the next try on the following message.\n\n  MAVLink uses only one start sign - isn't this less safe than using two or three start signs?\n  No. We use the CRC check to reliably determine whether a complete message has been received. Using additional start signs may increase likelihood of detecting the start point, but would provide no greater certainty of message validity. Since extra signs would increase bytes on the communication link, we choose not to use them.\n\n  What are the system and component IDs for?\n  The system ID represents the identity of a particular MAVLink system (vehicle, GCS, etc.). MAVLink can be used with up to 255 systems at the same time. The component ID reflects a component that is part of a larger system - for example a system might include an autopilot, companion computer and/or camera, which can be separately addressed. The component ID therefore lets MAVLink be used for both on- and off-board communication.\n\n  Why is the sequence number in the MAVLink header needed?\n  MAVLink is part of the safety critical components of an unmanned air system. A bad communication link dropping many packets can endanger the flight safety of the aircraft and has to be monitored. Having the sequence in the header allows MAVLink to continuously provide feedback about the packet drop rate and thus allows the aircraft or ground control station to take action.\n\n  Why is CRC_EXTRA needed in the packet checksum?\n  The CRC_EXTRA CRC is used to verify that the sender and receiver have a shared understanding of the over-the-wire format of a particular message \n  (required because as a lightweight protocol, the message structure isn't included in the payload).\n  \n  In MAVLink 0.9 the CRC was not used (although there was a length check). \n  There were a small number of cases where XML describing a message changed without changing the message length, \n  leading to badly corrupted fields when messages were read.\n\n  I would like to help improve the decoding/encoding routines or other features. Can MAVLink be changed?\n  Yes, but only very, very carefully with safety testing. \n  MAVLink is used as a safety-critical component in many autopilot systems and has undergone many years of testing. Please suggest new features on the MAVLink support channels.\n\n  How can I further reduce the generated C library size?\n  On extremely resource-constrained systems you may be able to reduce the size of the generated library by setting MAVLINK_COMM_NUM_BUFFERS=1 and MAVLINK_MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN=\"size of your largest buffer\" (assuming only one comm link and that your payload is less than the maximum supported by MAVLink).\n  You should also make sure that any buffers you use to pass into MAVLink are also as small as possible (e.g. the one passed into mavlink_msg_to_send_buffer()).\n  Another alternative is to use one of the other generators. For example fastMavlink asserts that it is smaller and more efficient than the libraries generated by mavgen (this has not been valided by the MAVLink project).\n\n\n\n\n"},"about/implementations.html":{"url":"about/implementations.html","title":"Implementations","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink Implementations\nMany autopilots, ground stations,

Libraries\nLanguage-specific MAVLink libraries can be created from XML Message Definitions using code generator tools.\nThis topic shows how to use the two code generators provided with the MAVLink project: mavgenerate (GUI) and mavgen (command line).\n\n These generators can build MAVLink 2 libraries for C, C++11, Python, Typescript, Java, and WLua (supporting both MAVLink 2 and 1), and MAVLink 1 (only) libraries for: C#, JavaScript, ObjC, Swift.\n\n\n\n Generators for other programming languages are supported and documented in independent projects.\n  For more information see Supported Languages.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nYou must already have Installed MAVLink (including both the tools below and XML Message Definitions).\nIf you are generating messages for a custom dialect, copy the file(s) into the directory message_definitions/v1.0/.\n mavgen can handle dialects that have relative paths for included XML files (e.g typically common.xml), but other generators may not. \n  We recommend putting custom dialects in the same folder as the ones that come with the mavlink/mavlink repository.\n\n\n\nMavgenerate (GUI) \nmavgenerate.py is GUI code generator for MAVLink, written in Python.\n\n Mavgenerate provides a GUI front end to the mavgen command line code generator, and supports the same options.\n\nThe GUI can be launched from anywhere using Python's -m argument:\npython3 -m mavgenerate\n\n\nGenerator Steps:\n\nChoose the target XML file (typically in mavlink/message_definitions/1.0).\n\n If using a custom dialect, first copy it into the above directory (if the dialect is dependent on common.xml it must be located in the same directory).\n\n\nChoose an output directory (e.g. mavlink/include).\nSelect the target output programming language.\n\n\n There are three JavaScript options:\n\nJavaScript_Stable is an older version that only supports MAVLink 1.0,\nJavaScript_NextGen is a more recent version that supports MAVLink 1 and 2 along with signing.\nJavaScript is a \"proxy\" for the recommended version. Currently this is JavaScript_Stable.\n\n\n\nSelect the target MAVLink protocol version (ideally 2.0)\n Generation will fail if the protocol is not supported by the selected programming language.\n\n\nOptionally check Validate and/or  Validate Units (if checked validates XML specifications).\nClick Generate to create the source files.\n\nMavgen (Command Line) \nmavgen.py is a command-line tool for generating MAVLink libraries for different programming languages.\nAfter the mavlink directory has been added to the PYTHONPATH, it can be run by executing from the command line.\n\n This is the backend used by mavgenerate.

(mavgen)","keywords":"","body":"Using C MAVLink Libraries (mavgen)\nThe MAVLink C library generated by mavgen is a header-only implementation that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. \nIt is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.\nThis topic explains how to get and use the library.\nGetting Libraries \nIf you are using a standard dialect then download the MAVLink 2 library from Github: c_library_v2.\n\n The MAVLink 2 library supports both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1, and is rebuilt for all the standard dialects whenever any of the definitions in the mavlink/mavlink repo change.\n  It supersedes the MAVLink 1 library (c_library_v1), and should be used by preference.\n\nIf you need libraries for a custom dialect then you will need to install mavgen and generate them yourself.\nThese can then be used in the same way as the pre-generated libraries.\nThe libraries can be placed/generated anywhere in your project tree.\nThe example below shows them located in: generated/include/mavlink/v2.0/.\nAdding Libraries\nTo use MAVLink in your C project, include the mavlink.h header file for your dialect:\n#include \n\nThis will automatically add the header files for all messages in your dialect, and for any dialect files that it includes.\n\n Only include the header file for a single dialect.\n  If you need to support messages from a number of dialects then create a new \"parent\" dialect XML file that includes them (and use its generated header as shown above).\n\n\n\n Do not include the individual message files.\n  If you generate your own headers, you will have to add their output location to your C compiler's search path.\n\nWhen compiling the project, we recommend that you specify the top-level output directory AND all generated dialects and versions (this will give the greatest compatibility with existing code and examples):\n$ gcc ... -I generated/include -I generated/include/common ...\n\nIn order to send messages you will also need to declare a variable mavlink_system in the global scope, specifying the system id and component ID of your component:\nmavlink_system_t mavlink_system = {\n    1, // System ID (1-255)\n    1  // Component ID (a MAV_COMPONENT value)\n};\n\nBuild Warnings\n-Waddress-of-packed-member\nBuilding the headers may result in warnings like:\nmavlink/common/../mavlink_helpers.h:86:24: warning: taking address of packed member of ‘__mavlink_message’ may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]\n   86 |  crc_accumulate_buffer(&msg->checksum, _MAV_PAYLOAD(msg), msg->len);\nThese can be ignored because MAVLink re-orders packed structures such that values are properly aligned.\nSpecifically all 4-byte values are aligned on 4-byte boundaries (by putting them first), all 2-byte values come after those and are hence also aligned, and last of all come the \nthe 1-byte values.\nYou can supress the warnings in CMake using target_compile_options(mavlink_c INTERFACE -Wno-address-of-packed-member -Wno-cast-align).\nUpgrading Library from MAVLink 1\nThe MAVLink 1 pre-built library mavlink/c_library_v1 can be upgraded by simply dropping in the MAVLink 2 library from Github: mavlink/c_library_v2.\nThe MAVLink 2 C library offers the same range of APIs as was offered by MAVLink 1. \n\n The major change from an API perspective is that you don't need to provide a message CRC table any more, or message length table.\n  These have been folded into a single packed table, replacing the old table which was indexed by msgId.\n  That was necessary to cope with the much larger 24 bit namespace of message IDs.\n\nMAVLink 2 usage is covered in the following sections (this includes Working with MAVLink 1 which explains how you can communicate with both MAVLink 2 and MAVLink 1 (only) libraries.\nMultiple Streams (\"channels\") \nThe C MAVLink library utilizes a \"channel\" metaphor to allow for simultaneous processing of multiple, independent MAVLink streams in the same program.\nAll receiving and transmitting functions provided by this library require a channel, and it is important to use the correct channel for each operation.\nBy default up to 16 channels may be defined on Windows, Linux and macOS, and up to 4 channels may be define on other systems.\nSystems can specify a different maximum number of channels/comms buffers using MAVLINK_COMM_NUM_BUFFERS (for example, this might be reduced to 1 if running MAVLink on very memory constrained hardware).\nIf only one MAVLink stream exists, channel 0 should be used by specifying the MAVLINK_COMM_0 constant.\nReceiving\nMAVLink reception/decoding is done in a number of phases: \n\nParse the incoming stream into objects representing each packet (mavlink_message_t).\nDecode the MAVLink message contained in the packet payload into a C struct (that has fields mapping the original XML definition).\n\nThese steps are demonstrated below.\nParsing Packets\nThe mavlink_parse_char(...) convenience function (mavlink_helpers.h) is used to parse incoming MAVLink data.\nThe function parses the data one byte at a time, returning 0 (MAVLINK_FRAMING_INCOMPLETE) as it progresses, and 1 (MAVLINK_FRAMING_OK) on successful decoding of a packet.\nThe r_mavlink_status parameter is updated with the channel status/errors as decoding progresses (you can check mavlink_status_t.msg_received to get the current byte's decode status/error and mavlink_status_t.parse_state for the current parse state).\nOn successful decoding of a packet, the r_message argument is populated with an object representing the decoded packet.\nThe function prototype and parameters are shown below:\nMAVLINK_HELPER uint8_t mavlink_parse_char(uint8_t chan, uint8_t c, mavlink_message_t* r_message, mavlink_status_t* r_mavlink_status)\n\nParameters:\n\nuint8_t chan: ID of the current channel.\nuint8_t c: The char to parse.\nmavlink_message_t* r_message: On success, the decoded message. NULL if the message couldn't be decoded.\nmavlink_status_t* r_mavlink_status: The channel statistics, including information about the current parse state.\n\nReturns: 0 if the packet decoding is incomplete. 1 if the packet successfully decoded.\nThe code fragment below shows the typical use of this function when reading data from a serial port (serial):\n#include \n\nmavlink_status_t status;\nmavlink_message_t msg;\nint chan = MAVLINK_COMM_0;\n\nwhile(serial.bytesAvailable > 0)\n{\n  uint8_t byte = serial.getNextByte();\n  if (mavlink_parse_char(chan, byte, &msg, &status))\n    {\n    printf(\"Received message with ID %d, sequence: %d from component %d of system %d\\n\", msg.msgid, msg.seq, msg.compid, msg.sysid);\n    // ... DECODE THE MESSAGE PAYLOAD HERE ...\n    }\n}\n\n\n The mavlink_helpers.h include other parser functions: mavlink_frame_char() and mavlink_frame_char_buffer().\n  Generally you will want to use mavlink_parse_char() (which calls those functions internally), but reviewing the other methods can give you a better understanding of the parsing process.\n\nDecoding the Payload \nThe message/packet object retrieved in the previous section(mavlink_message_t) contains fields in the MAVLink packet/serialization format - including the message id (msgid) and the payload (payload64).\nTo get the fields of the specific message in the packet you need to further decode the payload.\nThis is typically done by providing a case statement that maps the ids of the messages you wish to decode to appropriate decoder functions.\nThe code fragment below shows this for two messages (the first decodes a whole message into a C struct, while the second gets just a single field):\nif (mavlink_parse_char(chan, byte, &msg, &status)) {\n...\n\n    switch(msg.msgid) {\n      case MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GLOBAL_POSITION_INT: // ID for GLOBAL_POSITION_INT\n        {\n          // Get all fields in payload (into global_position)\n          mavlink_msg_global_position_int_decode(&msg, &global_position);\n\n        }\n        break;\n      case MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GPS_STATUS:\n        {\n          // Get just one field from payload\n          visible_sats = mavlink_msg_gps_status_get_satellites_visible(&msg);\n        }\n        break;\n     default:\n        break;\n    }\n\n...\n}\n\nThe decoder/encoder functions and ids for each message in a dialect can be found in separate header files under the dialect folder.\nThe headers are named with a format including the message name (mavlink_msg_message_name.h)\n\n Individual message definitions for the dialect are pulled in when you include mavlink.h for your dialect, so you don't need to include these separately.\n\nThe most useful decoding function is named with the pattern mavlink_msg_message_name_decode(), and extracts the whole payload into a C struct (with fields mapping to the original XML message definition).\nThere are also separate decoder functions to just get the values of individual fields.\nFor example, the common message GLOBAL_POSITION_INT is generated to common/mavlink_msg_global_position_int.h,\nand contains the following definitions:\n// Message ID number definition\n#define MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GLOBAL_POSITION_INT 33\n\n// Function to decode whole message into C struct\nstatic inline void mavlink_msg_global_position_int_decode(const mavlink_message_t* msg, mavlink_global_position_int_t* global_position_int)\n\n// C-struct with fields mapping to original message\nMAVPACKED(\ntypedef struct __mavlink_global_position_int_t {\n uint32_t time_boot_ms; /*\nCommand Decoding \nA MAVLink Command encodes a command defined in a MAV_CMD enum value into a COMMAND_INT or COMMAND_LONG message.\nCommand packets are parsed and decoded in the same way as any other payload - i.e. you switch on message id of MAVLINK_MSG_ID_COMMAND_INT/MAVLINK_MSG_ID_COMMAND_LONG and call the decoder functions mavlink_msg_command_int_decode()/mavlink_msg_command_long_decode() (respectively) to get a C struct mapping the original message.\n\n The message types differ in that COMMAND_INT has int32 types for parameter fields 6 and 7 (instead of float) and also includes a field for the geometric frame of reference of any positional information in the command.\n\nTo decode the specific command you then switch on the value of the mavlink_command_int_t.command or mavlink_command_long_t.command field, which contains the particular MAV_CMD id.\nFurther interpretation and handling of the message then has to be done manually (there are no convenience functions).\nAdditional Checks\nThe library have a number of #define values that you can set to enable various features:\n\nMAVLINK_CHECK_MESSAGE_LENGTH: \nEnable this option to check the length of each message.\nThis allows invalid messages to be caught much sooner. \nUse if the transmission medium is prone to missing (or extra) characters (e.g. a radio that fades in and out). \nOnly use if the channel will only contain messages types listed in the headers.\n\nTransmitting\nTransmitting messages can be done by using the mavlink_msg_*_pack() function, where one is defined for every message. \nThe packed message can then be serialized with mavlink_helpers.h:mavlink_msg_to_send_buffer() and then writing the resultant byte array out over the appropriate serial interface.\nIt is possible to simplify the above by writing wrappers around the transmitting/receiving code. \nA multi-byte writing macro can be defined, MAVLINK_SEND_UART_BYTES(), or a single-byte function can be defined, comm_send_ch(), that wrap the low-level driver for transmitting the data. \nIf this is done, MAVLINK_USE_CONVENIENCE_FUNCTIONS must be defined.\nMessage Signing\nMessage Signing (authentication) allows a MAVLink 2 system to verify that messages originate from a trusted source.\nThe C libraries generated by mavgen provide almost everything needed to support message signing in your MAVLink system.\nThe topic C Message Signing explains the remaining code that a system must implement to enable signing using the C library.\nWorking with MAVLink 1 \nThis section explains how to use the MAVLink 2 C library to work with MAVLink 1 systems.\nVersion Handshaking/Negotiation\nMAVLink Versions explains the handshaking used to determine the supported MAVLink version of either end of the channel, and how to negotiate the version to use.\nSending and Receiving MAVLink 1 Packets\nThe MAVLink 2 library will send packets in MAVLink 2 framing by default. \nTo force sending MAVLink 1 packets on a particular channel you change the flags field of the status object. \nFor example, the following code causes subsequent packets on the given channel to be sent as MAVLink 1:\nmavlink_status_t* chan_state = mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0);\nchan_state->flags |= MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1;\n\nIncoming MAVLink 1 packets will be automatically handled as MAVLink 1. If you need to determine if a particular message was received as MAVLink 1 or MAVLink 2 then you can use the magic field of the message. In c programming, this is done like this:\nif (msg->magic == MAVLINK_STX_MAVLINK1) {\n   printf(\"This is a MAVLink 1 message\\n\");\n}\n\nIn most cases this should not be necessary as the XML message definition files for MAVLink 1 and MAVLink 2 are the same, so you can treat incoming MAVLink 1 messages the same as MAVLink 2 messages.\n\n MAVLink 1 is restricted to message IDs less than 256, so any messages with a higher message ID won't be received as MAVLink 1.\n\nIt is advisable to switch to MAVLink 2 when the communication partner sends MAVLink 2 (see Version Handshaking). The minimal solution is to watch incoming packets using code similar to this:\nif (mavlink_parse_char(MAVLINK_COMM_0, buf[i], &msg, &status)) {\n\n    // check if we received version 2 and request a switch.\n    if (!(mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0)->flags & MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_IN_MAVLINK1)) {\n        // this will only switch to proto version 2\n        chan_state->flags &= ~(MAVLINK_STATUS_FLAG_OUT_MAVLINK1);\n    }\n}\n\nExamples\nThe following examples show the use of the API.\n\nUART Interface: Simple C example of a MAVLink to UART interface for Unix-like systems.\nUDP Example: Simple C example of a MAVLink UDP interface for Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS, BSD, etc.).\n\nIn addition, the C library is used in numerous open source systems:\n\nPX4\nArduPilot\nMAVSDK\n\n"},"mavgen_c/message_signing_c.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/message_signing_c.html","title":"Message Signing","keywords":"","body":"C Message Signing (mavgen)\nOne of the key features of MAVLink 2 is support for Message Signing (authentication).\nThe C libraries generated by mavgen provide almost everything needed to support signing in your MAVLink system.\nYou will need to add some code to:\n\nHandle the SETUP_SIGNING message.\nSetup and teardown signing on a link.\nSave and load the secret key and timestamp in persistent storage\nImplement a callback to define which (if any) unsigned messages will be accepted.\n\nSecret Key Management (SETUP_SIGNING)\nA secret key is 32 bytes of binary data that are used to create message signatures that can be verified by other holders of the key.\nThe general requirements for creating, storing, logging and sharing keys are covered in: Message Signing > Secret Key Management.\nThe section Enabling Signing on a Channel below shows how to set the secret key used by each channel.\n\nHandling Timestamps\nThe timestamp is a 48 bit number with units of 10 microseconds since 1st January 2015 GMT. \nThe general requirements for managing timestamps are covered in Message Signing > Timestamp Handling.\nThe library automatically handles some of the rules: \n\ntimestamps are incremented by one on every message send from a link.\ntimestamps are updated to match that of the last accepted incoming message (if it is greater than the current local timestamp).\nmessages are rejected if the timestamp of a message on a channel is before the last message received on that channel.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each MAVLink system to store and restore the timestamp into persistent storage (this is critical for the security of the signing system).\nThe section Enabling Signing on a Channel below shows how to set the timestamp.\n\nEnabling Signing on a Channel \nTo enable signing on a channel you need to fill in two pointers in the status structure for the channel. \nThe two pointers are:\nmavlink_signing_t *signing;\nmavlink_signing_streams_t *signing_streams;\n\nThe signing pointer controls signing for this stream. \nIt is per-stream, and contains the secret key, the timestamp and a set of flags, plus an optional callback function for accepting unsigned packets. Typical setup would be:\nmavlink_signing_t signing;\nmemset(&signing, 0, sizeof(signing));\nmemcpy(signing.secret_key, key.secret_key, 32);\nsigning.link_id = (uint8_t)chan;\nsigning.timestamp = key.timestamp; \nsigning.flags = MAVLINK_SIGNING_FLAG_SIGN_OUTGOING;\nsigning.accept_unsigned_callback = accept_unsigned_callback;\n\nmavlink_status_t *status = mavlink_get_channel_status(chan);\nstatus.signing = &signing;\n\nThe signing_streams pointer is a structure used to record the previous timestamp for a (linkId,srcSystem,SrcComponent) tuple. \nThis must point to a structure that is common to all channels in order to prevent inter-channel replay attacks. \nTypical setup is:\nmavlink_status_t *status = mavlink_get_channel_status(chan);\nstatus.signing_streams = &signing_streams;\n\nThe maximum number of signing streams supported is given by the MAVLINK_MAX_SIGNING_STREAMS macro. \nThis defaults to 16, but it may be worth raising this for GCS implementations. \nIf the C implementation runs out of signing streams then new streams will be rejected.\nUsing accept_unsigned_callback\nMessage Signing > Accepting Unsigned Packets and Accepting Incorrectly Signed Packets specify that a message signing implementation should provide mechanisms such that library users can choose to conditionally accept unsigned or incorrectly signed packets.\nThe C implementation provides the accept_unsigned_callback() function pointer for this purpose, which may optionally be set in the signing structure.\nThe C prototype for this function is:\nbool accept_unsigned_callback(const mavlink_status_t *status, uint32_t msgId);\n\nIf set then this function will be called on any unsigned packet (including all MAVLink 1 packets) or any packet where the signature is incorrect. \nThe function offers a way for the implementation to allow unsigned packets to be accepted (and incorrectly signed packets, which might be accepted under some circumstances).\nThe rules for what unsigned packets should be accepted is implementation specific, but it is suggested the following rules be considered:\n\nhave a mechanism for marking a particular communication channel as being secure (such as a USB connection) to allow for signing setup.\nalways accept RADIO_STATUS packets for feedback from 3DR radios (which don't do signing)\n\nFor example:\nstatic const uint32_t unsigned_messages[] = {\n    MAVLINK_MSG_ID_RADIO_STATUS\n};\n\nstatic bool accept_unsigned_callback(const mavlink_status_t *status, uint32_t message_id)\n{\n    // Make the assumption that channel 0 is USB and should always be accessible\n    if (status == mavlink_get_channel_status(MAVLINK_COMM_0)) {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    for (unsigned i = 0; i \nHandling Link IDs \nThe purpose of the link_id field in the MAVLink 2 signing structure is to prevent cross-channel replay attacks. \nWithout the link_id an attacker could record a packet (such as a disarm request) on one channel, then play it back on a different channel.\nThe intention with the link IDs is that each channel of communication between an autopilot and a GCS uses a different link ID. \nThere is no requirement that the same link ID be used in both directions however.\nFor C implementations the obvious mechanism is to use the MAVLink channel number as the link ID. \nThat works well for an autopilot, but runs into an issue for a GCS implementation. \nThe issue is that a user may launch multiple GCS instances talking to the same autopilot via different communication links (such as two radios, or USB and a radio). \nThese multiple GCS instances will not be aware of each other, and so may choose the same link ID. \nIf that happens then a large number of correctly signed packets will be rejected by the autopilot as they will have timestamps that are older than the timestamp received for the same stream tuple on the other communication link.\nThe solution adopted for MAVProxy is shown below:\nif (msg.get_signed() and\n    self.mav.signing.link_id == 0 and\n    msg.get_link_id() != 0 and\n    self.target_system == msg.get_srcSystem() and\n    self.target_component == msg.get_srcComponent()):\n    # change to link_id from incoming packet\n    self.mav.signing.link_id = msg.get_link_id()\nWhat that says is that if the current link ID in use by MAVProxy is zero, and it receives a correctly signed packet with a non-zero link ID then it switches link ID to the one from the incoming packet.\nThis has the effect of making the GCS slave its link ID to the link ID of the autopilot.\n"},"mavgen_c/examples.html":{"url":"mavgen_c/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\n\nUART Interface: Simple C example of

purpose MAVLink message processing library, written in Python.\nIt has been used to implement MAVLink communications in many types of MAVLink systems, including a GCS (MAVProxy), Developer APIs (DroneKit) and numerous companion computer MAVLink applications.\nThe library can be used with Python 2.7+ (recommended) or Python 3.5+ and supports both MAVLink 1 and MAVLink 2 versions of the protocol.\nThis topic explains how to get and use the Pymavlink MAVLink Python libraries (generated using mavgen).\n\n Pymavlink is developed in its own project, which includes the command line MAVLink generator (mavgen), Python bindings to create Pymavlink, and other useful tools and utilities.\n  MAVLink includes the Pymavlink repository as a submodule. \n  While you can work with that project directly, this documentation explains how to work with pymavlink using the MAVLink project.\n\n\n\n If you're writing a MAVLink application to communicate with an autopilot you may prefer to use a higher level library like MAVSDK-Python or DroneKit-Python.\n  These implement a number of MAVLink microservices.\n\nGetting Libraries\nIf you need a standard dialect then you can install these (for both MAVLink 1 and 2) with pymavlink using pip:\npip install pymavlink\n\n\n The PyPi repository takes message definitions from the ArduPilot/mavlink fork, which may diverge slightly from MAVLink/mavlink.\n\nIf you need libraries for a custom dialect then you will need to install mavgen and generate them yourself. \nYou will also need to include them in pymavlink and install them locally on your system.\n\nGenerate the Python libraries for your dialect.\nCopy the generated .py dialect file(s) into the appropriate directory of your clone of the mavlink repo: \nMAVLink 2: pymavlink/dialects/v20\nMAVLink 1: pymavlink/dialects/v10\n\n\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to the pymavlink directory.\nIf needed, uninstall previous versions:pip uninstall pymavlink\n\nInstall dependencies (if you have not previously installed pymavlink using pip):pip install lxml future\n\nRun the python setup program:python setup.py install --user\n\n\n\nThe libraries can then be used in the same way as those installed using pip.\nUsing the Libraries\nOverview\nThe pymavlink package includes the dialect-specific generated modules, which provide low-level functionality to encode and decode messages, and apply and check signatures.\nGenerally speaking, most developers will use the mavutil module to set up and manage the communication channel (because it makes getting started very easy). This module provides simple mechanisms for setting up links, sending and receiving messages, and querying some basic autopilot properties (e.g. flight mode). It provides access to the dialect module used for encoding/decoding/signing via an attribute (mav).\nThere are several main caveats to be aware of when using mavutil:\n\nThe link does not properly handle multiple systems running on the same port. \nIf you need a multi-vehicle network see source-system-filtering.\nThe module is optimised for ArduPilot and some functions may not work properly on other autopilots.\nmavutil is still a relatively low-level MAVLink API. \nIt has limited support for even the most common MAVLink microservices.\n\n\n You don't have to use mavutil but it includes a lot of useful code that you might otherwise have to write.\n  In particular the connection code and methods to filter incoming messages are useful for any autopilot.\n\nThe set of modules in the pymavlink package are listed below:\n\n\\dialects\\v20\\* and \\dialects\\v10\\*: Dialect modules corresponding to each source XML message definition for MAVLink v2 and v1, respectively. \nEach dialect module contains:\nconstants for all enums and enum values defined in the XML file.\na set of constants for message identifiers.\na class for each type of MAVLink message defined in the XML file.\na MAVLink class, which can be used to send and receive messages:\nhas _send and _decode functions for each message type.\nhas methods to check and apply signatures.\nhas lower-level methods for packing and parsing data.\n\n\n\n\nmavutil: MAVLink utility functions for setting up communication links, receiving and decoding messages, running periodic tasks, etc.\nmavutil.mavlink_connection(device, baud, ...) for setting up a link to (initially) listen for messages or send messages on a channel (e.g. udp, serial, etc.). This returns an object representing the connection. You can use:\nthemav attribute for accessing the selected dialect/protocol module to encode and send messages\nsetup_signing() for setting up signing\nrecv_match() for capturing messages with particular names/field values\n\n\nThe connection allows you to do a lot of other useful work: get all parameters, access last message of each type received, get current flight mode or armed state, etc.\n\n\nmavwp: Load/save waypoints, geofence, rally points.\nmavparm: Load/save sets of MAVLink parameters.\nmavextra: Useful functions for converting values and messages (e.g. metres/second to Km/h, eulers in radians from quaternion etc.).\nmavexpression (internal): MAVLink expression evaluation functions.\n\nChoosing the Dialect/MAVLink Version \nChoosing the Dialect/MAVLink version depends on whether you're using mavutil for link management or working directly with dialect files. \nBy default mavutil sets up the link to use the MAVLink 1 ardupilotmega dialect for sending/receiving. \nYou can change this by setting environment variables:\n\nMAVLINK_DIALECT: Set to string name for the dialect file (without XML extension).\nMAVLINK20: Set to 1 (if unset then default to MAVLink 1)\nMDEF: Location of message definition libraries\n\n\n You can also change the dialect by passing its name to mavutil.mavlink_connection() when setting up a connection.\n\nIf you're not using mavutil then you can import the dialect file that you want to use directly:\n# Import ardupilotmega module for MAVLink 1\nfrom pymavlink.dialects.v10 import ardupilotmega as mavlink1\n\n# Import common module for MAVLink 2\nfrom pymavlink.dialects.v20 import common as mavlink2\n\nSetting up a Connection \nThe mavutil module provides the mavlink_connection() method for setting up communication links to MAVLink systems over serial ports, tcp, or udp channels (it can also connect to a file object, which is useful when working with telemetry logs).\n\n The method returns an object that represents a single system, but will collect messages from multiple systems on the link.\n  This is OK for two-system networks, but if you need to connect over a multi-vehicle IP network see source-system-filtering.\n\nThe mavlink_connection() method takes a connection string defining the channel, and some optional arguments for setting the baud rate and other properties of the link (the format of the connection string automatically sets, and may override, some optional arguments).\nFor example, to connect to the standard MAVLink simulator UDP port, and wait for HEARTBEAT messages:\nfrom pymavlink import mavutil\n\n# Start a connection listening to a UDP port\nthe_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpin:localhost:14540')\n\n# Wait for the first heartbeat \n#   This sets the system and component ID of remote system for the link\nthe_connection.wait_heartbeat()\nprint(\"Heartbeat from system (system %u component %u)\" % (the_connection.target_system, the_connection.target_component))\n\n# Once connected, use 'the_connection' to get and send messages\n\n\n The udpin prefix used above creates a socket to listen for a UDP connection on the specified port\n  (this is the normal way to connect an autopilot simulator).\n  The complementary udpout prefix creates a socket that initiates an IP connection:\n  the_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection('udpout:localhost:14540')\n\n\nGenerally the API selects a sensible baud rate for the connection type.\nOther mavlink_connection() parameters you may wish to change include: source_system (default 255), source_component (default 0) and dialect (default ArduPilot).\nConnection Strings \nThe mavutil.mavlink_connection() connection string has the format:\n[protocol:]address[:port]\nwhere:\n\nprotocol (optional): \nThe IP protocol. \nIf not specified pymavlink will attempt to determine if the address is a serial port (e.g. USB) or a file, and if not will default to a UDP address.\ntcp: Initiate a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\ntcpin: Listen for a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\nudpin: Listen for a UDP connection on the specified address and port.\nudpout: Initiate a TCP connection on the specified address and port.\nudp: By default, same as udpin. Set mavlink_connection parameter input=False to make same as udpout.\nudpcast: Broadcast UDP address and port. This is the same as udp with mavlink_connection() parameters input=False and broadcast=True.\n\n\naddress: IP address, serial port name, or file name\nport: IP port (only if address is an IP address)\n\nSome of the strings you can use for different types of connections are listed below.\n\n\n\nConnection type\nConnection string\n\n\n\n\nLinux computer connected to the vehicle via USB\n/dev/ttyUSB0\n\n\nLinux computer connected to the vehicle via Serial port (RaspberryPi example)\n/dev/ttyAMA0 (also set baud=57600)\n\n\nMAVLink API listening for SITL connection via UDP\nudpin:localhost:14540 (or udp:localhost:14540, 127.0.0.1:14540,etc.) \n\n\nMAVLink API initiating a connection to SITL via UDP\nudpout:localhost:14540 (or udpout:127.0.0.1:14540)\n\n\nGCS connected to the vehicle via UDP\n127.0.0.1:14550 or udp:localhost:14550\n\n\nSITL connected to the vehicle via TCP\ntcp:127.0.0.1:5760 (ArduPilot only, PX4 does not support TCP)\n\n\nOSX computer connected to the vehicle via USB\ndev/cu.usbmodem1\n\n\nWindows computer connected to the vehicle via USB (in this case on COM14)\ncom14\n\n\nWindows computer connected to the vehicle using a 3DR Telemetry Radio on COM14\ncom14 (also set baud=57600)\n\n\n\n\n While MAVLink does not define the UDP ports used for different purposes, there is a defacto standard that MAVLink APIs should listen for SITL connections on UDP port 14540 while a GCS should listen for connections on UDP 14550.\n\nSending Messages \nMAVLink is the main protocol handling class. \nIt is defined in each dialect module, and includes a _send() method for all messages in the dialect's message definition.\nThe message field values are passed as arguments to the function (fields that are the same for all messages are defined in the class - e.g. source system, source component) and each message is documented in the dialect source code. \nFor example, the system_time_send() function (shown below) is used to send the SYSTEM_TIME message:\ndef system_time_send(self, time_unix_usec, time_boot_ms, force_mavlink1=False):\n    '''\n    The system time is the time of the master clock, typically the\n    computer clock of the main onboard computer.\n\n    time_unix_usec    : Timestamp (UNIX epoch time). (uint64_t)\n    time_boot_ms      : Timestamp (time since system boot). (uint32_t)\n    '''\n\nIf you're using mavutil for link management then the mav attribute provides access to a configured MAVLink class object that you can use for sending messages. \nFor example, to send the SYSTEM_TIME message using a link named the_connection:\nthe_connection.mav.system_time_send(time_unix_usec, time_boot_ms)\n\nOther examples can be seen in Publishing a Heartbeat and  Requesting Specific Messages below.\n\n If you're not using mavutil you will need to create and set up the MAVLink object yourself so it knows about channel that it should use for sending messages (represented by the file attribute).\n\nReceiving Messages\nIf you just want to synchronously access the last message of a particular type that was received (and when it was received) you can do so using the connection's mavutil.messages dictionary. \nFor example, if you're using a mavutil link named the_connection you can do:\ntry: \n    altitude = the_connection.messages['GPS_RAW_INT'].alt  # Note, you can access message fields as attributes!\n    timestamp = the_connection.time_since('GPS_RAW_INT')\nexcept:\n    print('No GPS_RAW_INT message received')\n\nAlternatively you can use the mavutil recv_match() method to wait for and intercept messages as they arrive:\ndef recv_match(self, condition=None, type=None, blocking=False, timeout=None):\n    '''Receive the next MAVLink message that matches the given type and condition\n    type:        Message name(s) as a string or list of strings - e.g. 'SYS_STATUS'\n    condition:   Condition based on message values - e.g. 'SYS_STATUS.mode==2 and SYS_STATUS.nav_mode==4'\n    blocking:    Set to wait until message arrives before method completes. \n    timeout:     ? \n    '''\n\nFor example using the_connection set up as before, you can wait for any message as shown:\nmsg = the_connection.recv_match(blocking=True)\n\nIf you instead want to just get a particular message with particular attribute values you might instead do:\n# Wait for a 'SYS_STATUS' message with the specified values.\nmsg = the_connection.recv_match(type='SYS_STATUS', condition='SYS_STATUS.mode==2 and SYS_STATUS.nav_mode==4', blocking=True)\nYou should also check that the message is valid before attempting to use it:\nmsg = m.recv_match(type='SYS_STATUS',blocking=True)\nif not msg:\n    return\nif msg.get_type() == \"BAD_DATA\":\n    if mavutil.all_printable(msg.data):\n        sys.stdout.write(msg.data)\n        sys.stdout.flush()\nelse:\n    #Message is valid\n    # Use the attribute\n    print('Mode: %s' % msg.mode)\n\nThe returned object is the subclass of MAVLink_message for the specific message. \nYou can access the message fields as class attributes (as shown for the mode in the above code fragment).\nIf needed, you can query MAVLink_message for information about the signature, CRC and other header information.\nRequesting Specific Messages \nA remote system will typically stream a default set of messages to a connected GCS, camera or other system\n(this default set may be hard coded, and is necessarily limited to reduce traffic on the channel).\nTypically a system can also request that additional information be provided by sending the REQUEST_DATA_STREAM message, specifying the required stream(s) (MAV_DATA_STREAM) and rate. \nThe message is sent using request_data_stream_send() (below arg.rate would be the desired transmission rate)\n# Request all data streams\nthe_connection.mav.request_data_stream_send(the_connection.target_system, the_connection.target_component,\n                                        mavutil.mavlink.MAV_DATA_STREAM_ALL, args.rate, 1)\nPublishing a Heartbeat \nAll MAVLink components should periodically broadcast a HEARTBEAT message and listen for heartbeats from other systems (systems consider themselves connected to another system if they regularly receive a HEARTBEAT from it).\n\n Sending Messages explains how messages are sent.\n\nThe HEARTBEAT message can be sent using MAVLink.heartbeat_send() message in the generated Python dialect file.\nThe method definition is provided below:\ndef heartbeat_send(self, type, autopilot, base_mode, custom_mode, system_status, mavlink_version=3, force_mavlink1=False):\n    '''\n    The heartbeat message shows that a system is present and responding.\n    The type of the MAV and Autopilot hardware allow the\n    receiving system to treat further messages from this\n    system appropriate (e.g. by laying out the user\n    interface based on the autopilot).\n\n    type              : Type of the MAV (quadrotor, helicopter, etc.) (type:uint8_t, values:MAV_TYPE)\n    autopilot         : Autopilot type / class.

For more information see Message Signing > Secret Key Management.\n\n\nSigning using MAVLink Class\nIf you're using the MAVLink class directly, you can use the MAVLink.signing attribute to access a MAVLinkSigning object and set the required attributes.\nThe example/mavtest.py script shows how to do this using an arbitrary secret key:\n# Create a MAVLink instance (in this case on a file object \"f\")\nmav = mavlink.MAVLink(f)\n\nif signing:\n    mav.signing.secret_key = chr(42)*32\n    mav.signing.link_id = 0\n    mav.signing.timestamp = 0\n    mav.signing.sign_outgoing = True\n\n\n The MAVLink class does not ensure that your link_id or initial timestamp are appropriate.\n  The initial timestamp should be based on current system time. \n  For more information see Message Signing.\n\nSigning using mavutil\nIf you're using mavutil to manage the connection then you can set up/disable signing using the methods shown below:\n#Setup signing\ndef setup_signing(self, secret_key, sign_outgoing=True, allow_unsigned_callback=None, initial_timestamp=None, link_id=None)\n\n# Disable signing (clear secret key and all the other settings specified with setup_signing)\ndef disable_signing(self):\n\nThe setup_signing() method sets up the MAVLink object owned by the connection and provides some additional code:\n\nIf link_id is not specified then internally the value is iterated.\nIf initial_timestamp is not set then an appropriate value for current time is populated from the underlying OS.\n\nUsing allow_unsigned_callback\nMessage Signing > Accepting Unsigned Packets and Accepting Incorrectly Signed Packets specify that a message signing implementation should provide mechanisms such that library users can choose to conditionally accept unsigned or incorrectly signed packets.\nPymavlink provides the optional allow_unsigned_callback() callback for this purpose.\nThe prototype for this function is:\nbool allow_unsigned_callback(self, msgId)\n\nIf set as part of the signing configuration then this function will be called on any unsigned packet (including all MAVLink 1 packets) or any packet where the signature is incorrect.\nIf the function returns False the message will be dropped (otherwise it will be handled as though signed). \nThe rules for what unsigned packets should be accepted is implementation specific, but it is suggested the implementations always accept RADIO_STATUS packets for feedback from 3DR radios (which don't support signing)\nFor example:\n# Assuming you already have a connection set up\nthe_connection = mavutil.mavlink_connection(...)\n\n# Create a callback to specify the messages to accept\ndef my_allow_unsigned_callback(self,msgId):\n    #Allow radio status messages\n    if msgId==mavutil.mavlink.MAVLINK_MSG_ID_RADIO_STATUS:\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Pass the callback  to the connection (here we also pass an arbitrary secret key)\nsecret_key = chr(42)*32\nthe_connection.setup_signing(secret_key, sign_outgoing=True, allow_unsigned_callback=my_allow_unsigned_callback)\n\n \nExamples\nThere are a number of useful examples and complete systems based on pymavlink:\n\nThe pymavlink submodule contains a number of simple examples.\nMAVProxy is a command-line, console based UAV ground station software package for MAVLink based systems. \nIt demonstrates most of the features of using the MAVLink module. \nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy\n\n\nDroneKit-Python is a developer API that builds on Pymavlink.\nIt implements a simpler high-level API for accessing vehicle information and also implementations of some of the MAVLink sub-protocols/microservices (eg. mission protocol).\nThe source code can be found here: https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python\n\n\n\nSupport\nPymavlink questions can be raised in the normal MAVLink support channels.\nThe Pymavlink Gitter channel also has an active support community.\n"},"guide/":{"url":"guide/","title":"Guide","keywords":"","body":"Guide\nThis section contains guide material for understanding and using MAVLink, including the different versions and microservices. \nThe topics linked from the sidebar (and listed below):\n\nMAVLink Versions\nMAVLink 2\nMicroservices (sub-protocols)\nMessage Signing\nSerialization\nRouting\nGeneral Telemetry\nOffboard Control\nUAVCAN Interaction\nScripts\nDebugging with Wireshark\nMAVLink XML Schema\nDefining XML Enums/Messages\nMAVLink CRCs\nDialects\n\n"},"guide/mavlink_version.html":{"url":"guide/mavlink_version.html","title":"MAVLink Versions","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink Versions\nMAVLink has been deployed in a number of versions:\n\nMAVLink 2.0: Current/recommended major version. Adopted by major users early 2017. \nMAVLink v1.0: Widely adopted around 2013. Still used by a number of legacy peripherals.\n\nThe MAVLink 2.0 C/C++ and Python libraries are backwards compatible with MAVLink 1.0 (support both protocols).\nVersion Handshaking and Negotiating Versions explain how to choose which version is used.\n\n MAVLink v0.9 is a pre-release version that is no longer supported. \n  The associated message set deleted in August 2018. \n  Legacy code may be present in generator and test code. \n\nDetermining Protocol/Message Version\nA library's MAVLink support can be determined in a number of ways:\n\nAUTOPILOT_VERSION.capabilities can be checked against the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag to verify MAVLink 2 support.\nPROTOCOL_VERSION.version contains the MAVLink version number multiplied by 100: v1.0 is 100,  v2.3 is 203 etc.\nHEARTBEAT.mavlink_version field contains the minor version number. \nThis is the  field defined in the Message Definitions (version in common.xml for dialects that depend on the common message set).\nThe major version can be determined from the packet start marker byte: \n\nMAVLink 1: 0xFE \nMAVLink 2: 0xFD\n\n\n A MAVLink library that does not support a protocol version will not recognise the protocol start marker; \n  so no messages will even be detected (see Serialization).\n\n\n\n\n While messages do not contain version information, an extra CRC is used to ensure that a library will only process compatible messages (see Serialization > CRC_EXTRA).\n\nVersion Handshaking \nSupport for MAVLink 2 is indicated in the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message by the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag. \nThis is sufficient if the communication link between autopilot and GCS is completely transparent. \nHowever, most communication links are not completely transparent as they either include routing or in case of fixed-length wireless implementations on packetization. \nIn order to also test the link, the MAVLink 2 handshake protocol sends a MAVLink 2 frame to test the complete communication chain.\nTo do so, the GCS sends a COMMAND_LONG or COMMAND_INT  message with the command ID MAV_CMD_REQUEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION.\nIf the system supports MAVLink 2 and the handshake it will respond with PROTOCOL_VERSION encoded as MAVLink 2 packet. \nIf it does not support MAVLink 2 it should NACK the command.\nThe GCS should fall back to a timeout in case the command interface is not implemented properly.\nThe diagram below illustrates the complete sequence.\n\n>Drone: MAV_CMD_REQUEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION\n    GCS->>GCS: Start timeout\n    Drone->>GCS: PROTOCOL_VERSION in MAVLink 2 framing\n    GCS->>Drone: If ACK: Switches to MAVLink 2\n    Drone->>GCS: Switches to MAVLink 2 on receive\n-->\nSemi-Transparent Legacy Radios\nSome popular legacy radios (e.g. the SiK radio series) operate in semi-transparent mode by injecting RADIO_STATUS messages into the MAVLink message stream. Per MAVLink spec these should actually emit a heartbeat with the same system ID and a different component ID than the autopilot to be discoverable. \nHowever, an additional heartbeat could be an issue for deployed systems. \nTherefore these radios can alternatively confirm their MAVLink 2 compliance by emitting RADIO_STATUS in v2 message format after receiving the first MAVLink v2 frame.\nVersions and Signing\nThe supported MAVLink library implementations enable different MAVLink versions on a per-channel basis, where a channel refers to a particular link in/out of a MAVLink system or component (e.g. a serial port or UDP port).\nAs a result, all connections to other components over a particular channel must share the same MAVLink version. If a system is using signing, then all connections via the same channel must also be signing messages with the same key.\n\n A system cannot use a single channel to connect to signed MAVLink 2 systems, unsigned MAVLink 2 systems, and/or MAVLink 1 components.\n\nCurrently most MAVLink networks are configured to use unsigned MAVLink 2 messages. \nMAVLink 1 is primarily used to allow autopilots to connect to legacy MAVLink peripherals, and this is done via a separate channel.\nSigned networks will need to use a further separate channel to connect to other signed systems. \nThe next section explains how a system/channel should negotiate the version to use.\nNegotiating Versions \nVehicle and GCS implementations will support both MAVLink 1 and MAVLink 2 for quite some time. \nWe would like most users to receive the benefit of MAVLink 2, while still supporting implementations that don't yet support MAVLink 2.\nThe following is meant to capture best practice for vehicle firmware and GCS authors:\n\nVehicle implementations should have a way to enable/disable the sending of MAVLink 2 messages. \nThis should preferably be on a per-link (channel) basis to allow for some peripherals to be MAVLink 1 while others are MAVLink 2. \nIt is acceptable for this option to require a reboot of the flight controller to take effect.\nIf signing is enabled then the vehicle should immediately start sending signed MAVLink 2 on startup.\nIf signing is not enabled and MAVLink 2 is enabled then the vehicle may choose to start by sending MAVLink 1 and switch to MAVLink 2 on a link when it first receives a MAVLink 2 message on the link.\nVehicles should set the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 capability flag in the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message if MAVLink 2 is available on a link. \nThis should be set in the case where the link is currently sending MAVLink 1 packets but MAVLink 2 packets will be accepted and will cause a switch to MAVLink 2.\nGCS implementations can choose to either automatically switch to MAVLink 2 where available or to have a configuration option for MAVLink 2.\nIf the GCS chooses to use a configuration option then when the option is enabled it should send MAVLink 2 on starting the link.\nIf the GCS chooses to use automatic switching then it should switch to sending MAVLink 2 if either it receives a MAVLink 2 message on the link or by asking for the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message to be sent and seeing the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_MAVLINK2 flag is set.\n\n"},"guide/mavlink_2.html":{"url":"guide/mavlink_2.html","title":"MAVLink 2","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink 2\nMAVLink 2 is a backward-compatible update to the MAVLink protocol that has been designed to bring more flexibility and security to MAVLink communication.\nMAVLink 2 bindings have been developed for C, C++11 and Python (see Supported Languages).\nThis topic provides links to the main new features in MAVLink 2 and how it is used.\nFeatures\nThe key new features of MAVLink 2 are:\n\n24 bit message ID -

Normally this is the same as the channel. \n\n\ntimestamp (48 bits)\nTimestamp in 10 microsecond units since 1st January 2015 GMT time. This must monotonically increase for every message on a particular link. Note that means the timestamp may get ahead of the actual time if the packet rate averages more than 100,000 packets per second.\n\n\nsignature (48 bits)\nA 48 bit signature for the packet, based on the complete packet, timestamp, and secret key.\n\n\n\nSee below for more information about the fields.\nLink IDs \nThe 8 bit link ID is provided to ensure that the signature system is robust for multi-link MAVLink systems. \nEach implementation should assign a link ID to each of the MAVLink communication channels it has enabled and should put this ID in the link ID field. The link ID is especially important where there may be a significant latency difference between different links (such as WiFi combined with a telemetry radio).\nThe monotonically increasing timestamp rule is applied separately for each logical stream, where a stream is defined by the tuple:\n(SystemID,ComponentID,LinkID)\n\n For more information see C Message Signing > Handling Link IDs.\n\nSignature \nThe 48 bit (6 byte) signature is the first 48 bits of a SHA-256 hash of the complete packet (without the signature, but including the timestamp) appended to the secret key.\nThe secret key is 32 bytes of binary data stored on both ends of a MAVLink channel (i.e. an autopilot and a ground station or MAVLink API).\nThis is shown below, where + represents concatenation and sha256_48() is a sha256 implementation which returns the first 48 bits of the normal sha256 output:\nsignature = sha256_48(secret_key + header + payload + CRC + link-ID + timestamp)\nTimestamp Handling \nThe timestamp is a 48 bit number with units of 10 microseconds since 1st January 2015 GMT. For systems where the time since 1/1/1970 is available (the unix epoch) you can use an offset in seconds of 1420070400.\n\n This is a loose definition, as the various update mechanisms detailed below may result in the timestamp being significantly different from actual GMT time.\n\nAll timestamps generated must be at least 1 more than the previous timestamp sent in the same session for the same link/(SystemID, ComponentID, LinkID) tuple.\nThe timestamp may get ahead of GMT time if there is a burst of packets at a rate of more than 100 thousand packets per second.\nA MAVLink-enabled device may not know the current GMT time, for example if it does not have a reliable time source, or if it has just booted and not yet obtained the time from GPS or some other system. \nSystems should implement the following rules to obtain a reliable timestamp:\n\nThe current timestamp should be stored regularly in persistent storage (ideally at least once a minute)\nThe timestamp used on startup should be the maximum of the timestamp implied by the system clock and the stored timestamp\nIf the system does not have an RTC mechanism then it should update its timestamp when GPS lock is achieved. The maximum of the timestamp from the GPS and the stored timestamp should be used.\nThe timestamp should be incremented by one on each message sent from a particular link.\nWhen a correctly signed message is decoded the timestamp should be replaced by the timestamp of the incoming message if that timestamp is greater than the current timestamp.\n The link timestamp must never be updated with the timestamp from an incorrectly signed packet (even if these are being accepted).\n\n\nThe timestamp on incoming signed messages should be checked against the previous timestamp for the incoming (linkID,srcSystem,SrcComponent) tuple and the message rejected if it is smaller.\nIf there is no previous message with the given (linkID,srcSystem,SrcComponent) then the timestamp should be accepted if it not more than 6 million (one minute) behind the current timestamp.\n\n\n For devices that store the timestamp in persistent storage, implementations can prevent race conditions by storing two timestamp values. \n  On write the smaller of the two values should be updated. On read the larger of the two values should be used.\n\nAccepting Signed Packets \nWhen a signed packet arrives it should be discarded if the:\n\nTimestamp is older than the previous packet from the same logical stream - where a logical stream is defined as the sequence of MAVLink packets with the same (SystemID, ComponentID, LinkID) tuple.\nComputed 48 bit signature does not match the signature included in the packet. \nThe timestamp is more than 1 minute (6,000,000) behind the local system’s timestamp.\n\nAccepting Unsigned Packets \nMAVLink libraries should provide a mechanism that allows a system to conditionally accept unsigned packets.\nThe rules for accepting these packets will be implementation specific, but could be based on a combination of a parameter setting, transport type, message type, (in)compatibility flags etc.\n\n All packets that do not meet the system-specific unsigned packet acceptance rules must be rejected\n  (otherwise there is no benefit gained from signing/authentication).\n\nSome suggestions for when to accept unsigned packets:\n\nAccept all unsigned packets based on a system-specific parameter.\nAccept all unsigned packets if the connection is over a \"secure channel\" (e.g. local USB cable or local wired Ethernet cable).\nRADIO_STATUS packets are always accepted without signing (to make life easier for telemetry radios).\nAccept all unsigned packets when in an \"unsigned mode\" (perhaps triggered by a hardware button pressed on boot).\nAccept all unsigned packets until a signed packet is received (unconditionally), then move to the more restricted signing rules above.\n\nAccepting Incorrectly Signed Packets \nMAVLink libraries should provide a mechanism that allows a system to conditionally accept incorrectly signed packets.\nThis feature might be useful for finding a lost vehicle with a corrupted secret key (the GCS could choose to still display position information, albeit ideally with a different \"untrusted\" icon).\n\n A system that is accepting incorrectly signed packets should provide a highly conspicuous indication that the connection is unsafe/insecure. Malformed signed packets indicate a bad configuration, transport failure, protocol failure, or hostile manipulation.\n\nSecret Key Management \nA secret key is 32 bytes of binary data that are used to create message signatures that can be verified by other holders of the key.\nThe key should be created on one system in the network (often a GCS) and shared to other trusted devices via secure channels.\nSystems must have a shared key in order to be able to communicate. \n\n The mavgen C and Python libraries support only one key per link. \n  This is a choice of the library and not a limit/requirement of the protocol.\n  An implementation might instead store a pool of keys, and/or manage keys on a per-connection basis.\n\nThe secret key should be stored in persistent storage, and must not be exposed via any publicly accessible communication protocol.\nIn particular, the key must not be exposed in MAVLink parameters, MAVLink log files or dataflash log files that may be used for public log analysis.\nThe method of generating the secret key is implementation dependent. \nFor example, it could be generated by:\n\nA user-entered string that is then run through SHA-256.\nA random key generator.\n\nThe secret key may be shared to other devices using the SETUP_SIGNING message.\nThe message should only ever be sent over a secure link (e.g. USB or wired Ethernet) as a direct message to each connected system_id/component_id.\nThe receiving system must be set up to process the message and store the received secret key to the appropriate permanent storage.\nThe same secure method can be used to both set and reset a system's key (reseting a key does not have to be \"more secure\" than setting it in the first place).\nThe SETUP_SIGNING message should never be broadcast, and received SETUP_SIGNING messages must never be automatically forwarded to other active MAVLink devices/streams/channels. \nThis is to avoid the case where a key received over a secure link (e.g. USB) is automatically forwarded to another system over an insecure link (e.g. Wifi).\nAutopilots that don't offer MAVLink over USB might create a module that can set the secret key from a command line interface (e.g. the NSH Shell).\n\n We recommend that GCS implementations should generate the secret key and share this with connected systems over a secure link (e.g. USB).\nThe receiving system may be configured to ignore message signatures on the secure channel (i.e. accept all signed, unsigned or incorrectly signed packets), so that it is possible to reset a key that has been lost or corrupted.\n\nLogging\nIn order to avoid leaking the secret key used for signing, systems should omit SETUP_SIGNING messages from logs (or replace the secret with 32 0xFF bytes in the logged message).\nSimilarly, signed packets should have the signature incompatibility bit cleared and the signature block removed before being put into telemetry log files.\nThis makes it harder for potential attacker to collect large amounts of signature data with which to attack the system. \nFurther Information\nThe Message Signing Proposal contains additional information, including:\n\nReasoning behind the design decisions.\nEvaluation of security effectiveness, including resistance to replay and offline attacks.\nAssumptions.\n\n\n Much of this content is derived from

The message may be forwarded either completely unaltered (i.e. with the zeros untrimmed and original CRC) or the forwarding implementation may trim the zeros and recalculate the CRC.\nThe actual fields affected/bytes saved depends on the message and its content \n(MAVLink field reordering means that all we can say is that any truncated fields will typically be those with the smallest data size, or extension fields).\n\n The first byte of the payload is never truncated, even if the payload consists entirely of zeros.\n\n\n\n The protocol only truncates empty bytes at the end of the serialized message payload; \n  any null bytes/empty fields within the body of the payload are not affected.\n\nCRC_EXTRA Calculation \nThe CRC_EXTRA CRC is used to verify that the sender and receiver have a shared understanding of the over-the-wire format of a particular message.\n\n Changes in message specifications that might make the over-the-wire format incompatible include: new/removed fields, or changes to field name, data type, order, or array length.\n\nWhen the MAVLink code generator runs, it takes a checksum of the XML structure for each message and creates an array define MAVLINK_MESSAGE_CRCS.\nThis is used to initialise the mavlink_message_crcs[] array in the C/C++ implementation, and is similarly used in the Python (or any other, such as the C# and JavaScript) implementation. \nWhen the sender calculates the checksum for a message it adds the CRC_EXTRA byte onto the end of the data that the checksum is calculated over.\nThe recipient calculates a checksum for the received message and adds its own CRC_EXTRA for the particular message id.\nIf the CRC_EXTRA for the sender and receiver are different the checksums will not match.\nThis approach ensures that only messages where the sender and recipient are using the same message structure will be decoded (or at least it makes a mistake much more unlikely, as for any checksum application).\nIf you are doing your own implementation of MAVLink you can get this checksum in one of two ways: you can include the generated headers and use MAVLINK_MESSAGE_CRCS to get the right seed for each message type, or you can re-implement the code that calculates the seed.\nAs MAVLink internally reorders the message fields according to their size to prevent word / halfword alignment issues (see Data structure alignment (Wikipedia) for further reference), and a wrongly implemented reordering potentially can cause inconsistencies as well, the CRC_EXTRA is calculated based on the over-the-air message layout rather than the XML order.\n\n MAVLink 2 extension fields are not included in the CRC_EXTRA calculation.\n\nThis is the Python code that calculates the CRC_EXTRA seed:\ndef message_checksum(msg):\n    '''calculate a 8-bit checksum of the key fields of a message, so we\n       can detect incompatible XML changes'''\n    from .mavcrc import x25crc\n    crc = x25crc()\n    crc.accumulate_str(msg.name + ' ')\n    # in order to allow for extensions the crc does not include\n    # any field extensions\n    crc_end = msg.base_fields()\n    for i in range(crc_end):\n        f = msg.ordered_fields[i]\n        crc.accumulate_str(f.type + ' ')\n        crc.accumulate_str(f.name + ' ')\n        if f.array_length:\n            crc.accumulate([f.array_length])\n    return (crc.crc&0xFF) ^ (crc.crc>>8)\n\n\n\n This uses the same CRC-16/MCRF4XX checksum that is used at runtime.\n  It calculates a CRC over the message name (such as “RAW_IMU”) followed by the type and name of each field, space separated.\n  The order of the fields is the order they are sent over the wire. For arrays, the array length is also added.\n\nChecksum \nThe packet format includes a 2-byte CRC-16/MCRF4XX to allow detection of message corruption.\nSee the MAVLink source code for the documented C-implementation.\nThe CRC covers the whole message, excluding magic byte and the signature (if present). \nThe CRC includes the CRC_EXTRA byte, which is used to ensure that the sending and receiving systems share a common understanding of the message definition.\n"},"guide/routing.html":{"url":"guide/routing.html","title":"Routing","keywords":"","body":"Routing\nThis topic explains how messages should be routed by MAVLink systems. \nOverview\nA MAVLINK network is made up of systems (vehicles, ground stations, antenna trackers, etc.), which may be composed from one or more components (autopilot, camera, servos, etc.).\nEach system has a network-unique system id, and each component has a system-unique component id that can be used for addressing/routing:\n\nThe system id has a value between 1 and 255. \nThe default autopilot system id is usually 1. Users should allocate unique increasing id values when adding new autopilots to a network.\nGCS systems and developer APIs typically use an ID at the top of the numeric range to reduce ID clashes (e.g. 255). Often their system ID is configurable to allow multi-GCS systems.\n\n\nThe component id is allocated by type and number from MAV_COMPONENT.\n\nMessages can be intended for all systems, specific systems, all components in a system, or specific components within a system. \nThe protocol defines two 8-bit fields that can (optionally) be specified in the message payload to indicate where the message should be sent/routed. If the ids are omitted or set to zero then the message is considered a broadcast (intended for all systems/components).\n\ntarget_system: System that should execute the command\ntarget_component: Component that should execute the command (requires target_system).\n\nMAVLink components are expected to process messages that have a matching system/component id and broadcast messages.\nThey are expected to route/resend messages that are intended for other (or all) recipients to other active channels\n(i.e. MAVLink systems may be connected across different transports, connected by a MAVLink system that routes the messages).\nBroadcast messages are forwarded to all channels that haven't seen the message. \nAddressed messages are resent on a new channel iff the system has previously seen a message from the target on that channel \n(messages are not resent if the addressee is not known or is on the original/incoming channel). \n\n Forwarded messages must not be changed/repackaged by the forwarding system (the original message is passed to the new link).\n\n\n\n Systems should, where possible, forward messages according to the routing rules even if they are unable to process them (e.g. signed messages that cannot be authenticated). Messages that are not supported/understood by the library should be forwarded as though they were broadcast messages (in this case the target system/component ids cannot be read).\n\nRouting Detail\nSystems/components should process a message locally if any of these conditions hold:\n\nIt is a broadcast message (target_system field omitted or zero).\nThe target_system matches its system id and target_component is broadcast (target_component omitted or zero).\nThe target_system matches its system id and has the component's target_component\nThe target_system matches its system id and the component is unknown (i.e. this component has not seen any messages on any link that have the message's target_system/target_component).\n\nSystems should forward messages to another link if any of these conditions hold:\n\nIt is a broadcast message (target_system field omitted or zero).\nThe target_system does not match the system id and the system knows the link of the target system (i.e. it has previously seen a message from target_system on the link).\nThe target_system matches its system id and has a target_component field, and the system has seen a message from the target_system/target_component combination on the link.\n\n\n Non-broadcast messages must only be sent (or forwarded) to known destinations (i.e. a system must previously have received a message from the target system/component).\n\n\n\n Systems should also check for SYSTEM_TIME messages with a decrease in time_boot_ms, as this indicates that the system has rebooted. \n  In this case it should clear stored routing information (and might perform other actions that are useful following a reboot - e.g. re-fetching parameters and home position etc.).\n\nLibrary Support\nC Library (mavgen)\nThe generated code for the MAVLink v1 C Library has no specific support for routing or working with target_system and target_component.\nTo extract this information you will need to use the normal methods provided for reading payload fields, and match on the field names.\nThe MAVLink v2 generator for the C library has been updated to make it easier to get the destination system and component ID from the payload (when these are assigned). \nSpecifically, the mavlink_msg_entry_t structure contains flags to tell you if the message contains target system/component information (FLAG_HAVE_TARGET_SYSTEM, FLAG_HAVE_TARGET_COMPONENT) and offsets into the payload that you can use to get these ids (target_system_ofs and target_component_ofs, respectively). The MAVLink helper method const mavlink_msg_entry_t* mavlink_get_msg_entry(uint32_t msgid) can be used to get this structure from the message id.\n\nMAVLink 2 Routing\nUnsigned MAVLink 2 packets are routed in the same way as MAVLink 1 packets.\nRouting Signed Packets \nSigned packets should be routed in the same way as any other packet.\nIn particular, a routing system should:\n\nnot change the message in any way (including replacing the original signature).\nforward a message according to normal rules even if it cannot be authenticated (or even understand) and hence cannot be processed locally.\n\nRouter Implementation\nThe MAVLink Router created by Intel allows to mix-and-match different IP protocols with serial ports and route MAVLink traffic.\nFurther Information\n\nMAVLink Routing in ArduPilot (ArduPilot DevGuide)\n\n"},"guide/general_telemetry.html":{"url":"guide/general_telemetry.html","title":"General Telemetry","keywords":"","body":"General Telemetry\nMAVLink is designed to support sending continuous telemetry streams including position, velocity, attitude and similar key states of a drone.\n"},"guide/offboard_control.html":{"url":"guide/offboard_control.html","title":"Offboard Control","keywords":"","body":"Offboard Control Interface\nThe offboard control interface allows to send low-level and high-level attitude, velocity or position commands to the vehicle.\n"},"file_formats/":{"url":"file_formats/","title":"File Formats","keywords":"","body":"File Formats\nMAVLink systems often need to be able to store, exchange, or restore MAVLink information, including: mission plans, geofence definitions, rally points, parameters, logs, etc.\nOften the information is defined on one system and used on another (e.g. logs from an autopilot are parsed by analysis tools, missions are created using GCS planning tools and run from a companion computer).\nThere is a defacto standard used in many GCS systems and developer APIs for storing mission information: plain-text file format.\n\n At time of writing there are no MAVLink standards (defacto or otherwise) for: geofence, rally points, parameters etc. \n  There is a discussion about standardising file formats in Issue #989.\n\nMission Plain-Text File Format \nQGroundControl and many other GCS support an older plain-text format for missions. \nThis is not officially part of MAVLink and does not allow rally point or geofence information to be provided.\nThe format is shown below. \nThe first line contains the file format and version information, while subsequent the line(s) are mission items.\nQGC WPL \n           \n\n The spaces between the numbers/fields above are  (i.e. \\t in most programming languages).\n\nFor example:\nQGC WPL 110\n0    1    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n1    0    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n2    0    0    16    0.149999999999999994    0    0    0    8.54800000000000004    47.3759999999999977    550    1\n"},"guide/uavcan_interaction.html":{"url":"guide/uavcan_interaction.html","title":"UAVCAN Interaction","keywords":"","body":"UAVCAN Interaction\nThis chapter describes the MAVLink commands and messages that facilitate data exchange between\nthe operator's equipment and the on-board UAVCAN nodes.\nThe primary motivation is to enable the user to configure, monitor, and control the on-board\nUAVCAN nodes via the existing MAVLink connection.\nBasics\nThe general description and specification of UAVCAN is available at http://uavcan.org.\nThe text below will be referring to the following terms:\n\nBridge node - the piece of on-board equipment that bridges the on-board UAVCAN bus and the\nMAVLink connection. This function is often performed by the flight management unit, e.g. Pixhawk.\nRemote equipment - the other end of the MAVLink channel, e.g. the ground control station.\n\nUAVCAN Node Identification\nEvery UAVCAN node has a bus-unique identifier referred to as \"node ID\".\nThe node ID is an integer in the interval [1, 127],\nwhere the value 1 is typically used by the autopilot or some other kind of central controlling unit,\nand the values 126 and 127 are typically used by debugging or monitoring equipment.\nEach unit that is capable of communicating via MAVLink and UAVCAN must use the same number for its\nMAVLink Component ID and the UAVCAN Node ID, otherwise serious inconsistencies may arise.\nTypically, if there is a single non-redundant autopilot, its UAVCAN Node ID and the MAVLink component\nID will be set to 1 (one).\nEvery outgoing/incoming MAVLink message/command pertaining to a given UAVCAN node will have its field\nComponent ID set to the same value as the Node ID of the referred UAVCAN node.\nNode Status Reporting\nNode Status Messages\nIn UAVCAN, the abstract node status information is represented by the standard message type\nuavcan.protocol.NodeStatus.\nIts MAVLink counterpart is UAVCAN_NODE_STATUS.\nThe bridge node should emit the MAVLink message UAVCAN_NODE_STATUS every time it receives\na UAVCAN node status message.\nThe bridge node is allowed to decimate the stream of node status messages in order to avoid\ncongestion of the MAVLink channel, but the resulting frequency of status message emission should not\nbe lower than 1 Hz per node.\nThe remote equipment can monitor which UAVCAN nodes are online by means of tracking the amount of\ntime that passed since the last reception of the node status message for each online node.\nThe remote equipment should consider the node to be offline if its last status message\nhas arrived more than 5 seconds ago.\nExtended Node Information\nUAVCAN nodes are typically able to report some static information that identifies their type,\npurpose, vendor, revision, and such, via the standard service type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nIn this context, \"static\" means that the data is not changing while the node is running.\nThis information can be crucial for many important use cases.\nThe corresponding MAVLink message is UAVCAN_NODE_INFO.\nIts fields are direct mappings of the corresponding fields in the service type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nThe bridge node must emit the message UAVCAN_NODE_INFO in the following cases:\n\nReception of a service response of type uavcan.protocol.GetNodeInfo.\nIn turn, this service must be invoked when the following conditions are observed on the bus\n(please read the UAVCAN specification for a more detailed description of the principles of bus monitoring):\nA new node has appeared online.\nA known node has restarted.\n\n\nReception of the MAVLink command MAV_CMD_UAVCAN_GET_NODE_INFO.\nIn this case, the bridge node is required to emit UAVCAN_NODE_INFO once for every known node.\nIt is also allowed, but not required, to unconditionally emit messages UAVCAN_NODE_INFO at a very low rate,\nin order to guarantee that the remote equipment always has a valid model of the on-board UAVCAN bus.\n\nConfiguration Parameter Management\nUAVCAN defines a set of standard service types that facilitate the management of configuration parameters\non UAVCAN nodes.\nThe respective data type definitions can be found in the namespace uavcan.protocol.param.\nThe UAVCAN-MAVLink bridge does not define any additional messages for configuration parameter management.\nInstead, the following standard messages are used in the regular way:\n\nPARAM_REQUEST_LIST - used to request the list of configuration parameters from the specified UAVCAN node.\nRemember that the UAVCAN node is specified via the field Component ID.\nPARAM_VALUE - used by the bridge node to report the value of a configuration parameter.\nThe node ID is reflected in the field Component ID.\nPARAM_SET - used by the remote equipment to set the value of a configuration parameter.\nThe node ID is reflected in the field Component ID.\n\nNote that the maximum length of a configuration parameter name is defined differently in UAVCAN and MAVLink.\nIn MAVLink, the maximum length is 16 characters, whereas in UAVCAN the limit is 92 characters.\nShould the bridge node encounter long configuration parameter names that exceed the MAVLink's limit,\nit should exercise its best effort to reduce the name length presented on the MAVLink side while\navoiding ambiguity.\nDesigners of UAVCAN nodes, on their part, should avoid using configuration parameter names more than\n16 characters long, until this deficiency of the MAVLink protocol is fixed.\nInternet Access Bridge\nUAVCAN defines a set of standard messages that facilitate communication between UAVCAN nodes and remote\nhosts on the Internet or LAN.\nThe tentative specification can be viewed on GitHub.\nIn the future, the set of MAVLink messages should be extended to allow forwarding of data packets between\nthe bridge node and the Internet via the remote equipment (e.g. ground control station).\nIf you're interested in this feature, please report to the\nUAVCAN mailing list.\n"},"guide/scripts.html":{"url":"guide/scripts.html","title":"Scripts","keywords":"","body":"Pymavlink Scripts\nThis MAVLink library also comes with supporting libraries and scripts for using, manipulating, and parsing MAVLink streams within the pymavlink, pymavlink/tools, and pymavlink/examples directories.\nThe scripts have the following requirements:\n\nPython 2.7+ and 3.3+\nPYTHONPATH specifies the directory path that contains the mavlink repository.\nWrite access to the entire mavlink folder.\nYour dialect's XML file is in message_definitions/*/\n\nThe scripts can be executed by running Python with the -m switch, which indicates that the given script exists on the PYTHONPATH.

This can be extended to multiple cells if the total voltage is greater than 2 * (UINT16_MAX - 1).\n      Battery current, -1: autopilot does not measure the current\n      Consumed charge, -1: autopilot does not provide consumption estimate\n      Consumed energy, -1: autopilot does not provide energy consumption estimate\n      Remaining battery energy. Values: [0-100], -1: autopilot does not estimate the remaining battery.\n      \n      Remaining battery time, 0: autopilot does not provide remaining battery time estimate\n      State for extent of discharge, provided by autopilot for warning or external reactions\n      Battery voltages for cells 11 to 14. Cells above the valid cell count for this battery should have a value of 0, where zero indicates not supported (note, this is different than for the voltages field and allows empty byte truncation). If the measured value is 0 then 1 should be sent instead.\n      Battery mode. Default (0) is that battery mode reporting is not supported or battery is in normal-use mode.\n      Fault/health indications. These should be set when charge_state is MAV_BATTERY_CHARGE_STATE_FAILED or MAV_BATTERY_CHARGE_STATE_UNHEALTHY (if not, fault reporting is not supported).\n    \n\nThe main message tags/fields are:\n\nmessage: Each message is encapsulated by message tags, with the following attributes\nid: The id attribute is the unique index number of this message (in the example above: 147). \nFor MAVLink 1:\nValid numbers range from 0 to 255.\nThe ids 0-149 and 230-255 are reserved for common.xml. \nDialects can use 180-229 for custom messages (provided these are not used by other included dialects). \n\n\nFor MAVLink 2:\nValid numbers range from 0 to 16777215.\nAll numbers below 255 should be considered reserved unless messages are also intended for MAVLink 1. \n IDs are precious in MAVLink 1!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname: The name attribute provides a human readable form for the message (ie \"BATTERY_STATUS\"). It is used for naming helper functions in generated libraries, but is not sent over the wire.\n\n\ndescription: Human readable description of message, shown in user interfaces and in code comments.\nThis should contain all information (and hyperlinks) to fully understand the message.\nfield: Encodes one field of the message. The field value is its name/text string used in GUI documentation (but not sent over the wire).\nEvery message must have at least one field.\n\ntype: Similar to a field in a C struct - the size of the data required to store/represent the data type.\nFields can be signed/unsigned integers of size 8, 16, 23, 64 bits ({u)int8_t, (u)int16_t, (u)int32_t, (u)int64_t), single/double precision IEEE754 floating point numbers. \nThey can also be arrays of the other types - e.g. uint16_t[10]. \n\n\nname: Name of the field (used in code).\nenum (optional): Name of an enum defining possible values of the field (e.g. MAV_BATTERY_CHARGE_STATE).\nunits (optional): The units for message fields that take numeric values (not enums). These are defined in the schema (search on name=\"SI_Unit\")\ndisplay (optional): This should be set as display=\"bitmask\" for bitmask fields (hint to ground station that enum values must be displayed as checkboxes).\nprint_format (optional): TBD.\ndefault (optional): TBD.\ninstance: If true, this indicates that the message contains the information for a particular sensor or battery (e.g. Battery 1, Battery 2, etc.) and that this field indicates which sensor. Default is false.\n\n This field allows a recipient automatically associate messages for a particular sensor and plot them in the same series.\n\n\ninvalid: Specifies a value that can be set on a field to indicate that the data is invalid: the recipient should ignore the field if it has this value.\nFor example, BATTERY_STATUS.current_battery specifies invalid=\"-1\", so a battery that does not measure supplied current should set BATTERY_STATUS.current_battery to -1.\nWhere possible the value that indicates the field is invalid should be selected to outside the expected/valid range of the field (0 is preferred if it is not an acceptable value for the field).\nFor integers we usually select the largest possible value (i.e. UINT16_MAX, INT16_MAX, UINT8_MAX, UINT8_MAX).\nFor floats we usually select invalid=\"NaN\".\nArrays represent multiple elements, some (or all) of which may need to be marked as invalid.\nThe following notation is used to specify the values that indicate elements of the array are invalid:\n\ninvalid=\"[value]\": Array elements that contain value are invalid.\ninvalid=\"[value:]\": All array elements are invalid if the first array element is set to value.\ninvalid=\"[value1,,value3,]\": Array elements are invalid if they contain the value specified in the corresponding position of the comma separated list.\n If the a position in the list is empty, there is no way to indicate the corresponding array element is invalid.\n The example above indicates that elements 1 and 3 are invalid if they contain value1 and value3, respectively.\n For element 2 and any elements >4 the invalid property of the field cannot be set.\ninvalid=\"[value1,]\": The first array element is invalid if it contains value1: the invalid property cannot be set for all other elements.\n\n\n\n\ndeprecated / wip (optional): A tag indicating that the message is deprecated or \"work in progress\".\n\nextensions (optional): This self-closing tag is used to indicate that subsequent fields apply to MAVLink 2 only. \nThe tag should be used for MAVLink 1 messages only (id \n\n\n\nCommon Tags\nThis section lists a number of tags can be used in a number of other types - e.g. messages and enums.\ndeprecated \nThe  tag can be used in an enum, enum entry (value) or message to indicate that the item has been superseded. \nThe tag attributes indicates the time of deprecation and the replacement item, while the element may (optionally) contain a string with additional information about the deprecation.\nThe generator toolchain can be configured to conditionally build messages omitting the deprecated entries.\n\n An entity should be marked as deprecated only when the main users have had an opportunity to update to the new method.\n\nAs a concrete example, below we see that SET_MODE is deprecated and replaced by MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE on 2015-12.\n    \n      Use COMMAND_LONG with MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE instead\n\nThe deprecated attributes are:\n\nsince: Year/month when deprecation started.

The message structure/fields and handling are largely unconstrained (i.e. up to the creator).\nMAVLink Commands are defined as entries in the MAV_CMD enum, and encoded into real messages that are sent using the Mission Protocol or Command Protocol. \nTheir structure is defined (they have 7 float parameters or 5 float and 2 int32_t parameters) and handling/responses depend on the protocol used to send them.\n\nThe guidance below provides some suggestions on when one or the other might be more appropriate.\nConsider using a proper message if:\n\nThe required information does not fit into a command (i.e. it can't fit into the 7 available numeric fields).\nThe message is part of another protocol.\nThe message must be broadcast or streamed (i.e. no ACK required)\n\nConsider using a command if:\n\nThe message should be executed as part of a mission.\nThere is an existing mission command that you wish to use outside of missions. \nDepending on the autopilot you may be able to handle the message using the same code for both modes.\nYou're working with MAVLink 1 and there is no free id for the new message\n(MAVLink 1 has a much larger free pool of ids for MAVLink commands than for message ids).\nIt is important that your command message is not missed, so an ACK/NACK is required. \nUsing the existing protocol acknowledgments may be faster/easier than defining another message for acknowledgments.\n\nOtherwise either method may freely be used.\nWhere are the MAVLink XML Files Located?\nThe \"official\" project XML files are stored in the Github repo mavlink/mavlink under /message_definitions/v1.0/.\nMAVLink systems typically fork and maintain a copy of this repo (e.g. ArduPilot/mavlink). The downstream repo should pull common.xml changes (see next section) down from the main repo and push dialect-specific changes back to it.\n\n The official repo is forked and/or cloned into your environment when you Install MAVLink.\n\n\n\n A project/dialect doesn't have to push changes back to MAVLink. \n  However this makes sense if you want to publish your messages more widely, and potentially get them moved into the common.xml message set.\n\nWhere Should MAVLink Elements be Created?\nThe enums and messages that are generally useful for many flight stacks and ground stations are stored in a file named common.xml, which is managed by the MAVLink project.\nThe MAVLink elements supported by a particular autopilot system or protocol are referred to as dialects. \nThe dialects are stored in separate XML files, which typically include (import) common.xml and define just the elements needed for system-specific functionality.\n\n When a MAVLink library is generated from a dialect file, code is created for all messages in both the dialect and any included files (e.g. common.xml), and entries for a particular enum are merged. \nThe generator reports errors if there are name or id clashes between imported messages or enum entries.\n\nWhere you define an element depends on whether it is common or a dialect, and whether the project is public or private.\nElements that are potentially useful for multiple ground stations and autopilots\n\nAdd these elements to common.xml (mavlink/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml) in the Github mavlink/mavlink repo.\nRaise a PR with your suggested changes and discuss with the MAVLink project through that mechanism.\n\nElements specific to a particular MAVLink dialect\n\nAdd these elements to the dialect file in the owning system's fork of the repo.\nRaise a PR with your suggested changes and discuss with the dialect project through that mechanism.\nThe dialect project should then (ideally) push the changes back to mavlink/mavlink. \n\nElements for a private project\n\nIf your enums/messages won't ever sync back to the MAVLink project then define them wherever you like!\n\nCreating a Dialect File\nTo create a new dialect file:\n\nFork mavlink/mavlink for your system and clone to your system\nCreate a dialect file named after your MAVLink system (e.g. flight stack) in message_definitions/v1.0/\nCopy the following text into the new file.\n\n\n\n    common.xml\n    9 -->\n    8\n\n    \n        \n    \n\n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\nThe template assumes that your dialect:\n\nimports common.xml (common.xml)\ntakes its version from common.xml  (which is why the version tags are commented out).\n\n\nUpdate the include(s):\n\nif the dialect is not based on common.xml remove the existing include line\nAdd additional   elements to import additional files/dialects.\n Includes in nested files are ignored.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the version:\nMost dialects should leave the version commented out (i.e. all dialects that include common.xml).\nDialects that are not based on common.xml can uncomment the 6 line and use whatever version is desired.\n The version specified in the top level file is used by default, if present. \nIf it is not present in the file, then a `version` from an included file is used. \n\n\n\n\nUpdate the 8 line to replace 8 with the next-largest unused dialect number (based on the other files in the folder).\nOptionally remove the enums or messages sections if you don't plan on declaring any elements of these types.\nAdd enums or messages as described in the following sections.\nSave the file, and create a PR to push it back to the mavlink/mavlink project repo.\n\nMessages \nMessages are used to send data between MAVLink systems (including commands, information and acknowledgments).\nEvery message has mandatory id, name, and description attributes, and at least one field.\nSerialised packets include the id in the message id section and an encoded form of the message data within the payload section.\nThe name is typically used by generators to name methods for encoding and decoding the specific message type.\nWhen a message is received the MAVLink library extracts the message id to determine the specific message, and uses that to find the appropriately named method for decoding the payload.\nA typical message (SAFETY_SET_ALLOWED_AREA) is shown below:\n    \n      Set a safety zone (volume), which is defined by two corners of a cube. This message can be used to tell the MAV which setpoints/waypoints to accept and which to reject. Safety areas are often enforced by national or competition regulations.\n      System ID\n      Component ID\n      Coordinate frame. Can be either global, GPS, right-handed with Z axis up or local, right handed, Z axis down.\n      x position 1 / Latitude 1\n      y position 1 / Longitude 1\n      z position 1 / Altitude 1\n      x position 2 / Latitude 2\n      y position 2 / Longitude 2\n      z position 2 / Altitude 2\n    \n\nCreating a Message\nMessages must be declared between the  tags in either common.xml or dialect files. \nEach message is defined using  ...  tags (with unique id and name attributes).\n\n The only only difference between messages defined in common.xml or dialect files is they they must use different id ranges in order to ensure that the ids are unique. See Message Id Ranges for more information.\n\nThe main rules for messages are:\n\nMessages must include the mandatory id and name\nThese must be unique across the generated library.\nSee Message Id Ranges below for more information.\n\n\nMessages should (very highly recommended) include a description. \nPoint to point messages must include a field for target_system (exactly as shown above).\nPoint to point messages that are relevant to components must include a field for target_component(exactly as shown above).\nThe total payload size (for all fields) must not exceed 255 bytes.\nAll other fields are optional.\nThere must be at least one field and no more than 64 fields.\nThe  tag may be added to messages that are still being tested.\nFields:\nmust have unique names within a message.\nshould have a description.\nshould use the units attribute rather than including units in the description. \nEach field should only have one or no units.\nshould use the enum attribute where possible results are finite/well understood.\n\n\n\n\n You cannot rely on generators to fully test for compliance with the above rules. \n  The mavgen code generator tests for duplicate message ids, duplicate field names, messages with no fields, and messages with more than 64 fields.\n  It does not check for other issues (e.g. duplicate names, or over-size payloads). \n  Other generators may provide better validation\n\nMessage Id Ranges \nAll messages within a particular generated library must have a unique ID - this is important because the id is used to determine the format of the message payload (i.e. what generated method can decode the message).\nFor MAVLink 2, each dialect is allocated a specific range from which an id can be selected. \nThis ensures that any dialect can include any other dialect (or common.xml) without clashes.\nIt also means that messages can move from a dialect to common.xml without any code needing to change.\nWhen creating a new message you should select the next unused id for your dialect (after the last one defined in your target dialect file).\nThe allocated ranges are listed below.\n\n\n\nDialect\nRange\n\n\n\n\nCommon.xml\n300 - 10000\n\n\nuAvionix.xml\n10001-10999\n\n\nArduPilotMega.xml\n11000 - 11999\n\n\nicarous.xml\n42000 - 42999\n\n\n\n\n If you are creating a new public dialect, create an issue to request your own message id range. For private dialects, you can use whatever range you like.\n\nYou should not create messages with ids in the \"MAVLink 1\" range (MAVLink v1 only has 8 bit message IDs, and hence can only support messages with ids 0 - 255). \n\nModifying a Message\nChanging the name or id of a message will make it incompatible with older versions of the generated library. \nAdding or removing a field, or changing the name or type of a field, will make a message incompatible with older versions of the generated library (the generated message decoding method is hard coded with the field number, order, type and position at build time - if these change, decoding will fail).\n\n Message Extensions (see below) allow you to add new fields to a MAVLink 2 message without breaking compatibility for a receiver that has not been updated. Note that you can only add messages, not modify or delete them using this mechanism.\n\nIf a message needs to be changed in these ways then there are several options:\n\nA new message can be created with the desired behaviour. \nAt some point the old message may be marked as deprecated.\nThe message can be updated, and the dialect version number iterated.\n\nFor either case, all users of the message will need to be updated with new client libraries.\nFor a message in common.xml either change requires the agreement of major stakeholders \n\nCreate a PR and discuss in the MAVLink developer meeting.\n\n Before proposing changes to common.xml check the codebase of major stakeholder to confirm impact.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to change the message and field descriptions without breaking binary compatibility.\nCare should still be taken to ensure that any changes that alter the way that the field is interpreted are agreed by stakeholders, and handled with proper version control.\nMessages are very rarely deleted, as this may break compatibility with legacy MAVLink 1 hardware that is unlikely to be updated to more recent versions.\nMessage Extensions (MAVLink 2) \nMAVLink 2 defines extension fields, which can be added to an existing message without breaking binary compatibility for receivers that have not been updated.\n\nAny field that is defined after the  tag in a message is an extension field. \nFor example, the OPTICAL_FLOW has flow_rate_x and flow_rate_y fields that will only be send in MAVLink 2:\n    \n      Optical flow from a flow sensor (e.g. optical mouse sensor)\n      Timestamp (UNIX)\n      Sensor ID\n      Flow in pixels * 10 in x-sensor direction (dezi-pixels)\n      Flow in pixels * 10 in y-sensor direction (dezi-pixels)\n      Flow in meters in x-sensor direction, angular-speed compensated\n      Flow in meters in y-sensor direction, angular-speed compensated\n      Optical flow quality / confidence. 0: bad, 255: maximum quality\n      Ground distance in meters. Positive value: distance known. Negative value: Unknown distance\n      \n      Flow rate in radians/second about X axis\n      Flow rate in radians/second about Y axis\n    \n\nThe rules for extensions messages are:\n\nExtension fields can be added messages with any id, including those in the MAVLink 1 message id range.\nExtension fields are not sent when a message is encoded using the MAVLink 1 protocol. \nIf received by an implementation that doesn't have the extensions fields then the fields will not be seen.\nIf sent by an implementation that doesn't have the extensions fields then the recipient will see zero values for the extensions fields.\nExtension fields are not reordered or included in the CRC_EXTRA when messages are serialized.\nNew extension fields must be added to the end of the message definition (for extension fields the serialization order is defined by XML definition order).\n\nOtherwise the rules are the same; once added you cannot modify or remove fields. \nYou can however continue to add new fields to the end of the message as long as you do not exceed the maximum field number or payload size limits.\n11032 (not filled)\nuAvionix.xml\n- MAVLink 2: 10001\nicarous.xml\n- MAVLink 2: 42000\nASLUAV\n-MAVLink 1:  78, 79, 201-212\nMatrixPilot\n- MAVLink 1: 150-158, 170-188\n\nOpen questions:\n- What other rules/guidance can we give. Some ideas:\n  - GCS find it easier to index /parse arrays, so consider using arrays for fields that represent sequential items - e.g. port values.\n  - Future proof - don't assume that values will be static forever.\n  - ?\n\n-->\nEnums \nEnums are used to define named values that may be used as options in messages - for example to represent errors, states, or modes.\nEvery enum has mandatory name attribute and may contain a number of entry elements (with enum-unique names) for the supported values. \nThe same enum may be declared in common.xml and multiple dialects.\nThe generated library will merge the entry values, and should report an error if there are any duplicate names.\nA typical enum (LANDING_TARGET_TYPE) is shown below:\n\n    Type of landing target\n    \n        Landing target signaled by light beacon (ex: IR-LOCK)\n    \n    \n        Landing target signaled by radio beacon (ex: ILS, NDB)\n    \n    \n        Landing target represented by a fiducial marker (ex: ARTag)\n    \n    \n        Landing target represented by a pre-defined visual shape/feature (ex: X-marker, H-marker, square)\n    \n\nCreating an Enum\nEnums must be declared between the  tags in common.xml and/or dialect files.\nEach enum is defined using  ...  tags (with a name attribute).\n\n There is no difference between enums defined in common.xml or dialect files (other than management of the namespace). \n\nThe main rules for enums are:\n\nEnums must include the mandatory name attribute.\nEntries are merged for all enums that share the same name.\n\n\nEnums should (very highly recommended) include a description. \nIf enums are merged, only one description will be used (usually the first that is encountered).\nEnums may be marked as deprecated.\nEnums must have at least one enum entry.\nEntries:\nmust have a name attribute.\nThe name must be unique across all entries in the enum.\nBy convention, the name should be prefixed with the enum name (e.g. enum LANDING_TARGET_TYPE has entry LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_LIGHT_BEACON).\n\n\nshould have a value attribute, and if assigned this must be unique within the (merged) enum.\nMissing values will automatically be sequentially assigned (starting from 1, if the first value is not assigned).\n We recommend you assign values because then new entries can be added within the range without breaking compatibility.\n\n\nshould (very highly recommended) include a description element. \nmay represent bitmasks, in which case values will increase by a power of 2.\nmay be marked as deprecated.\n\n\n\n\n You cannot rely on specific generators to fully test for compliance with the above rules.\n  mavgen tests for duplicate names in enums, duplicate names for (merged) enum entries, duplicate values for enum entries.\n\nModifying an Enum\nChanging the name or removing an enum will make any messages that use the enum incompatible with older versions of the generated library.\nSimilarly, changing an enum entry name or value, or removing an enum entry, will make messages that use the enum incompatible with older versions of the generated library.\nCare must be taken when adding a new enum entry/value as this may make the generated library incompatible:\n\nAutogenerated entry values may change\nClient code may not handle new values.\n\nIf an enum needs to be changed then there are several options:\n\nA new enum can be created with the desired entries. \nAt some point the old enum may be marked as deprecated.\nThe enum can be updated, and the dialect version number iterated. \n\nFor either case, all users of the enum will need to be updated with new generated libraries.\n\n Before proposing changes to common.xml check the codebase of major stakeholder to confirm impact.\n\nFor an enum in common.xml either change requires the agreement of major stakeholders\n\nCreate a PR and discuss in the MAVLink developer meeting.\n\nIt is possible to change enum/enum entry descriptions without breaking binary compatibility.\nCare should still be taken to ensure that any changes that alter the way that they are interpreted are agreed by stakeholders, and handled with proper version control.\nEnums are very rarely deleted, as this may break compatibility with legacy MAVLink 1 hardware that is unlikely to be updated to more recent versions.\nCommands \nMAVLink commands are defined as entries in the MAV_CMD enum.\nThey are used to define operations used in autonomous missions (see Mission Protocol) or to send commands in any mode (see Command Protocol).\n\n The schema for commands is documented here.\n\nA typical mission command is (MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT) is shown below:\n    \n      Commands to be executed by the MAV. They can be executed on user request, or as part of a mission script. If the action is used in a mission, the parameter mapping to the waypoint/mission message is as follows: Param 1, Param 2, Param 3, Param 4, X: Param 5, Y:Param 6, Z:Param 7. This command list is similar what ARINC 424 is for commercial aircraft: A data format how to interpret waypoint/mission data.\n      \n        Navigate to waypoint.\n        Hold time in decimal seconds. (ignored by fixed wing, time to stay at waypoint for rotary wing)\n        Acceptance radius in meters (if the sphere with this radius is hit, the waypoint counts as reached)\n        0 to pass through the WP, if &gt; 0 radius in meters to pass by WP. Positive value for clockwise orbit, negative value for counter-clockwise orbit. Allows trajectory control.\n        Desired yaw angle at waypoint (rotary wing). NaN for unchanged.\n        Latitude\n        Longitude\n        Altitude\n      \n      ...\n    \n\nThe rules for MAVLink commands are exactly the same as for other enums.\nThere are a few of additional conventions.\nCommand (Entry) Values \nAll mission command entries must have a value (this is not enforced by the toolchain but, as for other enums, it reduces the chance of values unintentionally changing and breaking other systems).\nEach dialect is allocated a specific range from which entry ids can be selected.\nThis ensures that any dialect can include any commands from any other dialect (or common.xml) without clashes.\nIt also means that messages can move from a dialect to common.xml without any code needing to change.\nDialects can choose any values within their range for any message.\nHowever we recommend that all related commands be kept in the same block of ids, and if there are likely to be more similar commands in future then spaces might be left for new commands. \nThe allocated ranges are listed below.\n\n\n\nDialect\nRange\n\n\n\n\nCommon.xml\n0 - 39999\n\n\nasluav.xml\n40001 - 41999\n\n\nArduPilotMega.xml\n42000 - 42999\n\n\nslugs.xml\n10001 - 11999\n\n\n\n\n If you are creating a new public dialect, create an issue to request your own command id range. For private dialects, you can use whatever range you like.\n\nThere are a number of common and ArduPilot commands that are outside the ranges (e.g. 16, 200, etc.). \nGenerally you would only use these these ranges in order to give a new command an id that is close to related to that of related commands.\nThis can be done provided that the command id value is not used by any other XML file in the mavlink/mavlink repo.\nEntry Names \nAs with other enums, enum entry names should be prefixed with the enum name (i.e. MAV_CMD_).\nIn addition, there are some other \"standard\" prefixes which are used for common types of commands: \n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_: NAV commands are used for navigation/movement commands (commands to go to a particular waypoint or move in a particular way).\nMAV_CMD_DO_: DO commands are used for setting modes, changing altitude or speed etc.\nMAV_CMD_CONDITION_: CONDITION_ commands are used to define conditions before the mission state machine will move to the next item (e.g. a time after reaching a waypoint before taking a picture).\nMAV_CMD_REQUEST_: For requesting information from a system.\n\n\n The rules for the above prefixes are flexible; some DO commands might reasonably be NAV commands.\n  Ins some cases a request for information might be a MAV_CMD_REQUEST_ and in others it might be a stand alone message.\n\nParameters (param) \nMessage data is encoded in the param values/attributes. \nStandard Mappings\nParameters (params) must have an index from 1 to 7. \nWhere a command contains position information, this is always stored in: Param 5 (x / latitude), Param 6 (y / longitude), Param 7 (z, altitude). \nWhether the value is local (x,y,z) or global (latitude, longitude, altitude) depends on the command and the frame used (frame often defined in the parent message).\nData types\nThe param data for index 1-4, 7 are always exchanged in a field with size float, while index 5, 6 may also be sent as an int32 (depending on the message used).\nThe implication is that index 5 and 6 should not be used for data that may need to be sent in a floating point value (like a NaN).\n\nReserved/Undefined Parameters \nMany commands do not need seven (or any) param values.\nThese unused parameters can be treated as reserved, allowing them to be reused later if the command needs to be extended.\nA reserved param must always be sent with a (default) value of either 0 or NaN (which will be interpreted by recipient as \"no action\" or \"not supported\").\nIf the param is reused the original default value must still mean \"no action\", so that an updated system can still interact with a system that has not been updated.\n\n Unfortunately this means that a reserved param must have its default value decided when the command is declared!\n  The default value cannot later be changed from NaN to 0 (or visa versa) without potential compatibility issues.\n\nTo declare a param as reserved with default value of NaN you should use the following syntax. \n\n\n Params with index values 5 and 6 should not be given a default of NaN , because if these are sent in a COMMAND_INT or MISSION_INT these parameters are integers (and hence there is no way to represent an NaN).\n\nTo declare a param as reserved with default value of 0 simply omit the param from the definition. This is the default - it is equivalent to: \n\n\nIf you have just one unused param we recommend you simply don't declare it. \nIf you have more than one, you may wish to explicitly define it with default of NaN so that you can extend your command later with either default. \nGUI Param Attributes\nA number of param attributes are provided as \"GUI hints\". \nThese attributes are used to better display params:\n\nlabel - Label for param in GCS/UI.\nAll words in label should be capitalised (e.g. \"Hold Altitude\").\nunits - SI units for the value.\ndecimalPlaces - Hint to a UI about how many decimal places to use if the parameter value is displayed.\n\nThese attributes help a GCS customise the editing experience (e.g. controls can choose to only offer allowed values).\n\nenum - Enum containing possible values for the parameter (if applicable).\nincrement - Allowed increments for the parameter value.\nminValue - Minimum value for param.\nmaxValue - Maximum value for the param.\n\n"},"guide/crc.html":{"url":"guide/crc.html","title":"MAVLink CRC","keywords":"","body":"MAVLink CRC\nMAVLink services that need to use a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) should choose the CRC32 algorithm described below.\n\n Using the same CRC implementation for all cases means that only one implementation is required. \n  Do not introduce another unless there without a compelling technical reason.\n\n\n\n This CRC is used for higher level services (it is not related to the CRC16 used for the checksum in MAVLink serialization).\n\nCRC32 Algorithm\nThe CRC32 algorithm used by MAVLink is similar to (but different from) the ISO 3309 standard based on the polygon 0x04C11DB7.\nIt is commonly referred to as \"the CRC32 based on Gary Brown's work\".\nThe difference of MAVLink's implementation versus the standard are:\n\nStart at 0 instead of 0xFFFFFFFF.\nMissing final XOR out operation with 0xFFFFFFFF.\n\nThe effects of the initial value and final XOR operation are documented in this brief tutorial on CRC computation of the Linux kernel.\nImplementations\nThis implementation is currently used in:\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP)\nParameter Protocol > PX4 Implementation (Implementation-specific hash of cached parameters).\n\n"},"guide/wireshark.html":{"url":"guide/wireshark.html","title":"Debugging with Wireshark","keywords":"","body":"Parsing MAVLink in Wireshark\nWireshark is an extremely popular \"general purpose\" network protocol analyzer that can be used to inspect and analyse MAVLink traffic.\nThe benefits of using Wireshark over other alternatives are:\n\nit can view all traffic on a network interface (GCS tools like MAVLink Inspector often only analyse incoming traffic).\nyou can use it to analyse traffic logged on a companion computer (this allows analysis of traffic between the companion computer and flight controller, which might otherwise not be visible to Wireshark).\nit is easy to update for new custom messages and dialects. \nRebuilding QGroundControl so you can use it analyse custom messages is much harder!\n\nThis topic shows how to generate a Wireshark plugin for a particular dialect file and install it on Wireshark, and how to perform basic filtering.\nIt also provides an overview of how you can use tcpdump for collecting traffic on a linux computer (for later analysis).\n\n You will need to regenerate and reimport the plugin (as shown below) if your dialect changes.\n\nGenerate MAVLink Lua Plugin for Wireshark\nFirst you will need to generate a Wireshark plugin that includes definitions for the MAVLink messages that you want it to handle.\nThe MAVLink generator (mavgen) can build this plugin for a dialect in the same way as it builds MAVLink libraries for other programming languages.\nThe steps are:\n\nInstall MAVLink (if you have not already done so).\nBuild libraries for your target dialect, specifing WLua as the target language.\nThis process is described in the toicGenerate MAVLink Libraries.\nFor example, to build the MAVLink 2 Wireshark plugin for common.xml you might use the following command:\npython3 -m pymavlink.tools.mavgen --lang=WLua --wire-protocol=2.0 --output=mavlink_2_common message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml\n\nThe plugin would be created in the current directory as: mavlink_2_common.lua. \n\n\nUpdate Plugin with Correct Ports\nThe last few lines of the plugin file specify the ports to be monitored: 14550 and 14580.\n-- bind protocol dissector to port 14550 and 14580\n\nlocal udp_dissector_table = DissectorTable.get(\"udp.port\")\nudp_dissector_table:add(14550, mavlink_proto)\nudp_dissector_table:add(14580, mavlink_proto)\nThese are the correct ports to monitor network traffic between a simulated autopilot and a GCS and offboard API.\nIf you want to monitor other interfaces then you can modify or add to these lines and then save the plugin file.\nThis might be necessary, for example, in order to monitor traffic recorded on the interface between a companion computer and a flight controller.\nImport Lua Plugin into WireShark\nTo import the plugin into Wireshark:\n\nCopy the plugin file into the wireshare plugins directory.\nOn Linux systems this might be: ~/.wireshark/plugins. Note that users will need to be added to the wireshark group to use the tool.)\nOn Windows this might be: Program Files/Wireshark/plugins.\n\n\nOpen Wireshark and follow the menu: Help > About Wireshark > Plugins\nYou should find the plugin in the list.\nFor example, with the plugin created in the previous section you would see mavlink_2_common.lua \n\n\nView Traffic on Wireshark\nWireshark can inspect any interface on the host computer on which it is running.\nSo you can use it to inspect traffic between a GCS and running on the same computer and a real or simulated computer.\nFor example assuming you have a simulator and ground station running on the same computer, select the Adapter for loopback traffic capture.\n\nThis will display all traffic on the interface.\nWith the MAVLink WLua plugin installed, MAVLink message names are displayed next to each UDP packet that contains a MAVLink message.\n\nYou can filter to show just the MAVLink traffic using mavlink_proto in the filter box (below we also filter on not icmp to remove additional control packets).\n\nClick on a particular message to find out its details.\nBelow you can see the payload and the header details for an ATTITUDE_TARGET message:\n\nFiltering using MAVLink Properties\nIn addition to using filters for the usual Wireshark things (e.g. ips and ports) you can also use the new MAVLink filters.\n\n This works the same way for live view and for a pcapng file loaded into Wireshark\n\nWe already saw you can filter for MAVLink packets using mavlink_proto\nThe following is a filter example:\nmavlink_proto.msgid==0 && mavlink_proto.compid == 1 && \n(ip.addr == 10.0.115.155 && ip.dst == 10.0.115.141)\nThis means to filter for:\n\nMavlink msgid=HEARTBEAT\nMavlink src compid=AUTOPILOT\nsrc IP=10.0.115.155\ndst IP=10.0.115.141\n\nCapture MAVLink Stream\nOn Linux you can use tcpdump to capture stream on a specific interface.\nThis can be performed either on your laptop or on the offboard computer:\napt update\napt install tcpdump\ntcpdump -i eth0 -w mavlink-capture.pcap\nCapture tcpdump (MAVLink) data live from a remote machine on a local WireShark\ntcpdump must be installed on the remote machine.\nWhen you can access the remote machine with SSH you can stream the tcpdump to your local machine instead of logging it to a file.\nWireshark can open this stream and show the decoded MAVLink messages using the tools and filters from above.\nmkfifo /tmp/mavlink;\nwireshark -k -i /tmp/mavlink &\nssh root@10.41.1.1 -p 33333 \"tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i lo not port 33333\" > /tmp/mavlink;\n\n Username, IP and port above have to be adjusted to the configuration on the remote machine.\n\n\nmkfifo /tmp/mavlink Creates a named pipe that is used to stream the data.\nwireshark -k -i /tmp/mavlink & Start Wireshark, open the named pipe as input and start the capture immediately. \nStart the data stream on the remote machine and pipe it into the named pipe on your local machine.\n\n-s 0 Set snapshot length to default\n-U Stream packet output packet-buffered, don’t wait for a full buffer\n-n Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names\n-w - Write raw data to standard output (piped to the local machine)\n-i lo Define which interface to listen on.\nThis will listen to the loopback interface, you can change this to the Ethernet, USB or modem interface.\nnot port 33333 Don’t capture the data created by the SSH session.\nYou can add more filters to tcpdump to reduce the streamed data.\n\n\n\nMeasuring MAVLink data rates using Wireshark\nAfter the plugin is setup in Wireshark ad you have started to capture a stream you can use the Wireshark IO graphsto  monitor message rates for either the whole stream or just specific messages.\nTo do this you need to go to Statistics > I/O Graphs and you will get a new window.\nNow you will a plot of the data rate of all packets you are analyzing.\nYou can filter for the usual Wireshark filters and the new MAVLink ones introduced by the LUA script.\nWe recommend changing the y axis to bits or bytes and to reduce the x axis to 10ms or faster to get meaningful plots.\n"},"messages/":{"url":"messages/","title":"Dialects","keywords":"","body":"\nDialects \nMAVLink dialects are XML definition files that define protocol- and vendor-specific messages, enums and commands.\nDialects may include other MAVLink XML files, which may in turn contain other XML files (up to 5 levels of XML file nesting are allowed - see MAXIMUM_INCLUDE_FILE_NESTING in mavgen.py).\nA typical pattern is for a dialect to include common.xml (containing the MAVLink standard definitions), extending it with vendor or protocol specific messages.\nStandard Definitions\nThe following XML definition files are considered standard/core (i.e. not dialects):\n\nminimal.xml - the minimum set of entities (messages, enums, MAV_CMD) required to set up a MAVLink network.\nstandard.xml - the standard set of entities that are implemented by almost all flight stacks (at least 2, in a compatible way).\nThis includes minimal.xml.\ncommon.xml - the set of entitites that have been implemented in at least one core flight stack.\nThis includes standard.xml\n\nFurther, all.xml is a special case.\nIt includes almost all other XML definition files, and can be used to verify that there are no ID clashes (and can potentially be used by GCS to communicate with any core dialect).\n\n We are still working towards moving the truly standard entities from common.xml to standard.xml\n  Currently you should include common.xml\n\nCore Dialects\nCore dialects are stored in mavlink/message definitions.\nThese are the dialects for the major MAVLink stakeholder flight stacks.\n\n Vendor forks of MAVLink may contain dialect messages that are not yet merged, and hence will not appear in this documentation.\n\nHuman-readable forms of all the the core dialects are linked below:\n\nASLUAV.xml\nAVSSUAS.xml\nall.xml\nardupilotmega.xml\ndevelopment.xml\nicarous.xml\nmatrixpilot.xml\npaparazzi.xml\npython_array_test.xml\nstorm32.xml\ntest.xml\nuAvionix.xml\nualberta.xml\n\nExternal Dialects\nMAVLink provides the /external/dialects folder for dialects from projects that are not maintained by core MAVLink stakeholders or part of the MAVLink standard.\nThis mechanism is provided to help non-stakeholder dialect owners avoid clashes with other dialects (and the standard), and to ease integration of generic behaviours into the standard in future.\nThese are not managed by the core team and do not appear in this documentation.\nInformation about using the folder can be found in github: /external/dialects\n\n We highly recommend that you work with the standard and core stakeholder dialects rather than using this approach (there are significant benefits in terms of compatibility and adoptability when using the standard definitions).\n\n"},"messages/ASLUAV.html":{"url":"messages/ASLUAV.html","title":"ASLUAV.xml","keywords":"","body":"\nDialect: ASLUAV\nThis is a human-readable form of the XML definition file: ASLUAV.\n\n\n MAVLink 2 messages have an ID > 255 and are marked up using (MAVLink 2) in their description.\n\n\n\n MAVLink 2 extension fields that have been added to MAVLink 1 messages are displayed in blue.\n\n\ntd {\n    vertical-align:top;\n}\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n   MAVLink Include Files:\n   common.xml\n  \n  MAVLink Type Enumerations\n  GSM_LINK_TYPE\n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     0\n     \n      GSM_LINK_TYPE_NONE\n     \n     no service\n    \n    \n     1\n     \n      GSM_LINK_TYPE_UNKNOWN\n     \n     link type unknown\n    \n    \n     2\n     \n      GSM_LINK_TYPE_2G\n     \n     2G (GSM/GRPS/EDGE) link\n    \n    \n     3\n     \n      GSM_LINK_TYPE_3G\n     \n     3G link (WCDMA/HSDPA/HSPA)\n    \n    \n     4\n     \n      GSM_LINK_TYPE_4G\n     \n     4G link (LTE)\n    \n   \n  \n  GSM_MODEM_TYPE\n  \n   \n    [Enum]\n   \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Value\n     Field Name\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     0\n     \n      GSM_MODEM_TYPE_UNKNOWN\n     \n     not specified\n    \n    \n     1\n     \n      GSM_MODEM_TYPE_HUAWEI_E3372\n     \n     HUAWEI LTE USB Stick E3372\n    \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  MAVLink Commands (MAV_CMD)\n  \n   \n   \n   MAVLink commands (MAV_CMD) and messages are different!

If the system is following the MAVLink standard, the system state is mainly defined by three orthogonal states/modes: The system mode, which is either LOCKED (motors shut down and locked), MANUAL (system under RC control), GUIDED (system with autonomous position control, position setpoint controlled manually) or AUTO (system guided by path/waypoint planner). The NAV_MODE defined the current flight state: LIFTOFF (often an open-loop maneuver), LANDING, WAYPOINTS or VECTOR. This represents the internal navigation state machine. The system status shows whether the system is currently active or not and if an emergency occurred. During the CRITICAL and EMERGENCY states the MAV is still considered to be active, but should start emergency procedures autonomously. After a failure occurred it should first move from active to critical to allow manual intervention and then move to emergency after a certain timeout.\n  \n   \n    \n     Field Name\n     Type\n     Units\n     Values\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     onboard_control_sensors_present\n     uint32_t\n     \n     \n     \n      MAV_SYS_STATUS_SENSOR\n     \n     Bitmap showing which onboard controllers and sensors are present.

The flags message is an integer bitmask containing information on which EKF outputs are valid. See the ESTIMATOR_STATUS_FLAGS enum definition for further information. The innovation test ratios show the magnitude of the sensor innovation divided by the innovation check threshold. Under normal operation the innovation test ratios should be below 0.5 with occasional values up to 1.0. Values greater than 1.0 should be rare under normal operation and indicate that a measurement has been rejected by the filter. The user should be notified if an innovation test ratio greater than 1.0 is recorded. Notifications for values in the range between 0.5 and 1.0 should be optional and controllable by the user.\n  \n   \n    \n     Field Name\n     Type\n     Units\n     Values\n     Description\n    \n   \n   \n    \n     time_usec\n     uint64_t\n     us\n     \n     \n     Timestamp (UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot).
